**Step 4: Likelihood Assessment**

**Factors to Consider**:

- Threat actor capability

- Ease of exploitation
- Existing controls
- Historical incidents
- Industry trends

**Likelihood Ratings**:

- **Low**: Unlikely to occur (0-25% probability)

- **High**: Likely to occur (75-100% probability)

**Evidence Sources**:

- Threat intelligence feeds
- Industry reports (Verizon DBIR, etc.)
- Incident history
- Security assessments
- Vulnerability scan results

**Step 5: Impact Analysis**

**Impact Categories**:

   - Direct losses (fraud, theft)
   - Regulatory fines and penalties
   - Legal costs
   - Remediation costs
   - Customer compensation
   - Lost revenue

2. **Operational Impact**:
   - Business disruption

   - Contractual breaches
   - Certification loss
   - Consent orders

**Impact Ratings**:

- **Low**: Minimal impact, easily recoverable (<$50K, <1 day disruption)
- **Medium**: Moderate impact, recoverable ($50K-$500K, 1-7 days disruption)
- **High**: Severe impact, difficult recovery (>$500K, >7 days disruption, regulatory action)

**Step 6: Control Evaluation**

**Existing Controls Inventory**:

**Preventive Controls**:

**Control Effectiveness**:

- **Effective**: Control adequately mitigates risk
- **Partially Effective**: Control provides some mitigation
- **Ineffective**: Control does not mitigate risk

**Step 7: Risk Calculation**

**Risk Formula**: Risk = Likelihood × Impact

**Risk Matrix**:

|               | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|---------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **High Likelihood** | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Medium Likelihood** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Low Likelihood** | Low | Low | Medium |

**Risk Levels**:

- **Critical**: Immediate action required
- **High**: Address within 30 days
- **Medium**: Address within 90 days
- **Low**: Monitor, address as resources allow

**Residual Risk**: Risk remaining after existing controls applied

## Risk Assessment Methodologies

### NIST-Based Approach

**Framework**: NIST SP 800-30 "Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments"

**Process**:

1. Prepare for assessment
2. Conduct assessment (identify threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact)
3. Communicate results
4. Maintain assessment (ongoing)

**Advantages**:

- Well-documented
- Widely recognized
- Comprehensive
- Free/public resource

**Tools**: NIST 800-30 templates, RMF tools

### ISO 27005 Approach

**Framework**: ISO/IEC 27005 "Information Security Risk Management"

**Process**:

1. Context establishment
2. Risk identification
3. Risk analysis
4. Risk evaluation
5. Risk treatment

**Advantages**:

- International standard
- Aligns with ISO 27001
- Systematic approach

**Considerations**: Requires ISO 27005 standard (not free)

### Qualitative Methodology

**Approach**: Use subjective ratings (High/Medium/Low) for likelihood and impact

**Advantages**:

- Fast and simple
- Low resource requirements
- Understandable to non-technical stakeholders

**Disadvantages**:

- Subjective assessments
- Harder to prioritize
- May lack precision

**Best For**: Small institutions, initial assessments, limited resources

### Quantitative Methodology

**Approach**: Calculate numerical risk values based on financial impact

**Formulas**:

- **ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)** = ARO × SLE
- **ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)**: Expected frequency per year
- **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)**: Expected loss per incident

**Advantages**:

- Objective, data-driven
- Enables cost-benefit analysis
- Supports budget justification

**Disadvantages**:

- Requires extensive data
- Time-consuming
- Difficult to quantify reputational impact

**Best For**: Large institutions, mature risk programs, justifying major investments

## Risk Treatment Options

### 1. Mitigate (Reduce)

**Strategy**: Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact

**Examples**:

- Deploy MFA to reduce account compromise risk
- Implement encryption to reduce data exposure impact
- Add SIEM to improve detection

**When Appropriate**: Cost of control < risk reduction benefit

### 2. Transfer (Share)

**Strategy**: Shift risk to third party

**Examples**:

- Cyber insurance
- Outsource to managed service provider
- Cloud service provider shared responsibility

**When Appropriate**: Cost-effective transfer available, residual risk acceptable

### 3. Accept (Retain)

**Strategy**: Acknowledge risk and take no additional action

**Examples**:

- Low-likelihood, low-impact risks
- Cost of mitigation exceeds potential loss
- Business justification for accepting risk

**Requirements**:

- Documented risk acceptance by management
- Periodic review
- Monitoring for changes

### 4. Avoid (Eliminate)

**Strategy**: Eliminate the risk by discontinuing activity

**Examples**:

- Decommission vulnerable legacy system
- Discontinue high-risk service
- Exit high-risk market

**When Appropriate**: Risk unacceptable and cannot be adequately mitigated

## Common Risk Assessment Challenges

1. **Scope Creep**:
   - Assessment expands beyond original scope
   - **Solution**: Clear boundaries, phased approach

2. **Data Availability**:
   - Incomplete asset inventory
   - Lack of historical incident data
   - **Solution**: Discovery tools, industry benchmarks, assumptions

3. **Subjectivity**:
   - Inconsistent likelihood/impact ratings
   - **Solution**: Defined rating criteria, calibration sessions

4. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Limited staff time
   - Budget limitations
   - **Solution**: Prioritized scope, automated tools, consultants

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - Business units unresponsive
   - Lack of executive support
   - **Solution**: Executive sponsorship, communicate value, involve early

## Integration with Safeguards Rule

**Risk Assessment Feeds**:

1. **Safeguard Selection** (Element #3): Use risk assessment to prioritize controls
2. **Monitoring and Testing** (Element #4): Focus testing on high-risk areas
3. **Training** (Element #5): Tailor training to identified threats
4. **Service Provider Selection** (Element #6): Risk-based due diligence
5. **Program Evaluation** (Element #7): Use findings to adjust program
6. **Incident Response** (Element #8): Prepare for likely incident scenarios
7. **Board Reporting** (Element #9): Report top risks to board

**Continuous Process**: Risk assessment not one-time exercise; ongoing risk management
