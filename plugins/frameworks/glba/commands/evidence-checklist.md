# GLBA Evidence Checklist

Generates comprehensive evidence collection checklists for Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) Safeguards Rule and Privacy Rule compliance for financial institutions.

> **Never commit evidence artifacts to source control.** The outputs below include real usernames, credential reports, MFA device states, and privileged-account inventories. `.gitignore` covers `evidence/` by default so `git add -A` will not sweep it up, but durable storage is your responsibility. Use an encrypted, access-controlled evidence locker (encrypted S3 with least-privilege IAM, a GRC platform, or a shared drive with full-disk encryption and MFA-gated access).

## Usage

```bash
/glba:evidence-checklist <rule-section> [--institution-type <bank|broker|insurer>] [--export <format>]
```

## Arguments

- `<rule-section>`: GLBA section (e.g., "Safeguards Rule", "Privacy Rule", "§314.4(b)") or topic (e.g., "Information Security Program", "Customer Privacy Notices")
- `--institution-type`: Type of financial institution (`bank`, `broker`, `insurer`, `other`). Default: `bank`
- `--export`: Export format (`json`, `csv`, `markdown`). Default: `markdown`

## Example: Safeguards Rule - Information Security Program Evidence

```bash
/glba:evidence-checklist "Safeguards Rule" --institution-type bank
```

**Output:**

```markdown
GLBA Evidence Checklist

Regulator: FTC (Federal Trade Commission) / FDIC / OCC / NCUA (depending on charter)

## Safeguards Rule Compliance Assessment

Regulators (FTC, FDIC, OCC, NCUA) will verify:

### Documentation Review

✓ Written Information Security Program (WISP) exists and is comprehensive
✓ Qualified Individual designated in writing
✓ Annual risk assessments performed (documented)
✓ Safeguards documented for all identified risks
✓ Monitoring and testing program documented
✓ Training program documented
✓ Service provider oversight documented
✓ Incident response plan documented
✓ Annual Board reports submitted and reviewed

### Implementation Review

✓ Encryption at rest for customer information
✓ Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+ for all customer data transmission)
✓ MFA implemented for accessing customer information
✓ Access controls (least privilege, user authentication)
✓ Secure disposal procedures
✓ Change management process
✓ Service provider contracts include required security clauses

### Testing and Validation

✓ Annual penetration testing performed
✓ Vulnerability assessments performed (at least annually)
✓ Continuous monitoring or periodic testing in place
✓ Incident response plan tested
✓ Training completion records (100% of staff)

## Common Regulatory Findings

### Critical (Likely to Result in Enforcement Action)

❌ No Written Information Security Program (WISP)
❌ No Qualified Individual designated
❌ No annual risk assessment performed
❌ No encryption of customer information at rest or in transit
❌ No multi-factor authentication for accessing customer information
❌ No annual penetration testing
❌ No annual Board report

### Moderate (Requires Remediation)

⚠️ WISP incomplete (missing required elements)
⚠️ Risk assessment not performed annually
⚠️ Some customer information not encrypted
⚠️ MFA not enforced for all access to customer information
⚠️ Service provider contracts missing required security clauses
⚠️ Penetration test >12 months old
⚠️ Incident response plan not tested

### Minor (Best Practice Recommendations)

⚠️ WISP not reviewed in last 12 months
⚠️ Training completion not 100%
⚠️ Service provider assessments not performed annually
⚠️ Monitoring dashboards incomplete

## Remediation Guidance

### If No WISP Exists

1. **Week 1**: Download FTC WISP template and customize
2. **Weeks 2-4**: Document all required elements (risk assessment process, safeguards, monitoring, training, service providers, incident response)
3. **Week 5**: Review with Qualified Individual and legal counsel
4. **Week 6**: Present to Board for approval
5. **Week 7**: Distribute to organization and begin implementation

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL (foundational requirement)

### If No MFA Implemented

1. **Week 1**: Inventory all systems accessing customer information
2. **Week 2**: Select MFA solution (AWS IAM MFA, Okta, Duo, etc.)
3. **Weeks 3-4**: Pilot MFA with IT team
4. **Weeks 5-8**: Roll out to all users accessing customer information
5. **Week 9**: Enforce MFA (no access without MFA)

**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL (§314.4(c)(6) requirement)

### If No Annual Penetration Test

1. **Week 1**: Select penetration testing vendor
2. **Week 2**: Define scope (external + internal tests, systems with customer information)
3. **Weeks 3-6**: Execute penetration test
4. **Week 7**: Receive report and findings
5. **Weeks 8-12**: Remediate critical and high findings
6. **Week 13**: Retest critical/high findings

**Timeline**: 12-14 weeks
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL (§314.4(d)(3) requirement)

### Maps to Other Frameworks

- **NIST 800-53**: All families (GLBA aligns closely with NIST)
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: All 5 functions
- **ISO 27001:2022**: Annex A controls
- **SOC 2**: All Trust Service Criteria
- **FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment Tool**: All domains
