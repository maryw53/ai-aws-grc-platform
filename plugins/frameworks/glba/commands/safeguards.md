   - Vendor fatigue with security questionnaires
   - **Solution**: Tiered approach based on risk, accept certifications (SOC 2), vendor risk platforms

5. **Board Reporting**:
   - Board lacks technical expertise
   - Unclear reporting requirements
   - **Solution**: Executive summaries with business impact, security metrics dashboards

## Board Reporting Requirements
