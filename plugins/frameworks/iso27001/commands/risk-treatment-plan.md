━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL RISKS (Immediate Action Required)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RISK-001: Insufficient Disaster Recovery Capabilities
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Inherent Risk Level: 🔴 CRITICAL (Likelihood: 3, Impact: 5) = Risk Score 15

Threat:
  Natural disaster, cyber attack, or infrastructure failure affecting AWS
  us-east-1 region could cause extended service outage.

Vulnerability:
  - Single-region deployment (no cross-region failover)
  - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 8 hours (target: 4 hours)
  - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 4 hours (target: 1 hour)
  - No automated failover mechanism

Impact if Realized:
  - Extended service outage (>8 hours)
  - Customer data loss (up to 4 hours)
  - Revenue loss: $50,000/day
  - Reputation damage
  - SLA breach penalties
  - Regulatory reporting requirements (if >72 hours)

Assets Affected:
  - Production RDS databases
  - Application servers (EC2, ECS)
  - Customer-facing web application
  - 10,000+ active customers

Treatment Option: ✓ MITIGATE

Planned Controls:
  1. Multi-Region Architecture (Primary: us-east-1, DR: us-west-2)
     - RDS cross-region read replicas (real-time replication)
     - S3 cross-region replication
     - Route 53 health checks and automatic failover
     - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for DR region

  2. Automated Disaster Recovery Procedures
     - Automated failover scripts (tested quarterly)
     - DR runbook documentation
     - Quarterly DR testing (full failover test)

  3. Enhanced Backup Strategy
     - Continuous backup to DR region
     - 30-day backup retention
     - Automated backup validation

Implementation Timeline:
  Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): DR region infrastructure deployment
  Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Data replication setup and testing
  Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Automated failover implementation
  Phase 4 (Week 13): First DR test

  Target Completion: March 31, 2025

Responsibility:
  Owner: VP Engineering
  Implementer: DevOps Team
  Reviewer: CISO

Budget:
  Initial: $35,000 (DR infrastructure setup, testing)
  Ongoing: $12,000/year (DR region running costs)

Expected Residual Risk:
  Level: 🟡 MEDIUM (Likelihood: 2, Impact: 3) = Risk Score 6
  Justification: Multi-region architecture reduces likelihood and limits impact
  Acceptance: Residual risk within tolerance (no further action required)

Evidence:
  - DR architecture diagram (to be created)
  - Terraform DR configuration (to be created)
  - DR test results (quarterly, starting Q2 2025)
  - RTO/RPO metrics (monitored post-implementation)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RISK-002: Inadequate Vendor Risk Management
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Inherent Risk Level: 🔴 CRITICAL (Likelihood: 4, Impact: 4) = Risk Score 16

Threat:
  Third-party vendor security breach leads to compromise of customer data
  or service disruption. Recent supply chain attacks (SolarWinds, MOVEit)
  demonstrate this threat is actively exploited.

Vulnerability:
  - 47 third-party vendors with access to systems/data
  - Only 12/47 vendors have completed security assessments (26%)
  - No continuous monitoring of vendor security posture
  - No vendor incident response integration
  - Vendor offboarding process incomplete (orphaned access)

Impact if Realized:
  - Customer data breach via vendor compromise
  - Regulatory fines (GDPR: up to 4% of revenue)
  - Customer notification requirements
  - Reputational damage
  - Loss of customer trust

Assets Affected:
  - Customer data (PII, payment information)
  - Internal systems accessed by vendors
  - Shared infrastructure (Okta, AWS, GitHub)

Treatment Option: ✓ MITIGATE

Planned Controls:
  1. Vendor Risk Assessment Program
     - Risk assessment for all vendors (prioritize by data access)
     - Annual reassessment (high-risk vendors: quarterly)
     - Security questionnaire (SOC 2, ISO 27001, insurance)
     - Risk scoring (critical/high/medium/low)

  2. Vendor Contract Requirements
     - Data protection clauses (GDPR Article 28 compliant)
     - Right to audit clause
     - Breach notification requirements (24 hours)
     - Cyber insurance requirements ($5M minimum for high-risk vendors)

  3. Continuous Vendor Monitoring
     - SecurityScorecard or BitSight ratings (automated)
     - Breach monitoring (have vendors been compromised?)
     - SOC 2 report review (annually)

  4. Vendor Access Management
     - Least privilege access (minimum necessary)
     - Quarterly vendor access reviews
     - Automated offboarding when contract ends

Implementation Timeline:
  Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Vendor inventory and categorization
  Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6): Risk assessments (prioritize high-risk first)
  Phase 3 (Weeks 7-10): Contract reviews and amendments
  Phase 4 (Weeks 11-12): Continuous monitoring setup

  Target Completion: April 30, 2025

Responsibility:
  Owner: CISO
  Implementers: Security Team, Legal, Procurement
  Reviewer: Risk Committee

Budget:
  Initial: $18,000 (SecurityScorecard subscription, assessments)
  Ongoing: $15,000/year (monitoring platform, annual reassessments)

Expected Residual Risk:
  Level: 🟡 MEDIUM (Likelihood: 2, Impact: 3) = Risk Score 6
  Justification: Vendor assessments and monitoring reduce likelihood;
                contracts limit impact via insurance and liability
  Acceptance: Residual risk within tolerance

Evidence:
  - Vendor Risk Management Policy v1.0 (to be created)
  - Vendor risk assessment reports (47 vendors)
  - Vendor contracts with security clauses (all new/renewed contracts)
  - SecurityScorecard dashboards
  - Quarterly vendor access review results

HIGH RISKS (Priority Action Required)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RISK-008: Insufficient Security Awareness Training
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Inherent Risk Level: 🟠 HIGH (Likelihood: 4, Impact: 3) = Risk Score 12

Threat:
  Employees fall victim to phishing attacks, leading to credential compromise,
  malware infection, or unauthorized data access.

Vulnerability:
  - Annual security training only (not frequent enough)
  - No phishing simulation testing
  - Training completion: 98% (2 employees overdue)
  - Training is generic (not role-specific)

Impact if Realized:
  - Credential compromise leading to unauthorized access
  - Malware infection (ransomware, data exfiltration)
  - Business email compromise (BEC) financial fraud
  - Customer data breach

Assets Affected:
  - Employee credentials (142 users)
  - Email system (Office 365)
  - Internal systems (AWS, GitHub, Jira)

Treatment Option: ✓ MITIGATE

Planned Controls:
  1. Enhanced Security Awareness Program
     - Quarterly security training (instead of annual)
     - Role-based training (developers, IT, general staff)
     - Microlearning modules (5-10 minutes monthly)

  2. Phishing Simulation Testing
     - Monthly simulated phishing campaigns
     - Immediate training for users who click
     - Tracking and metrics (click rate, reporting rate)
     - Target: <5% click rate, >50% reporting rate

  3. Security Champions Program
     - Designate security champions in each team
     - Monthly security updates and discussions
     - Incident response training

Implementation Timeline:
  Immediate: Q1 2025
  Ongoing: Monthly phishing tests, quarterly training

Responsibility:
  Owner: CISO

  Training Provider: KnowBe4 or similar

Budget:
  Initial: $8,000 (platform setup, initial content)
  Ongoing: $12,000/year ($7/user/month for 142 users)

Expected Residual Risk:
  Level: 🟢 LOW (Likelihood: 2, Impact: 2) = Risk Score 4
  Justification: Training reduces likelihood; other controls (MFA, email
                filtering) limit impact
  Acceptance: Residual risk acceptable

Evidence:
  - Security Awareness Training Policy v1.1
  - Training completion reports (quarterly)
  - Phishing simulation results (monthly)
  - Click rate trends (target: improving)

  Ongoing: $2,000/year (Inspector costs)

Expected Residual Risk:
  Level: 🟢 LOW (Likelihood: 1, Impact: 3) = Risk Score 3

Evidence:
  - Patch Management Policy v1.3
  - SSM Patch Manager configuration
  - Weekly vulnerability scan results
  - Patch compliance reports (target: >95%)
