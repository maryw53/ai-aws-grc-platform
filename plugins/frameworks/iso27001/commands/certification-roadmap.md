      - What locations (cloud regions, offices)?
      - What organizational boundaries?

    Example Scope Statement:
      "The ISMS covers all systems and processes used to provide the
       [Product Name] SaaS application to customers, including AWS
       infrastructure in us-east-1 and us-west-2 regions, application
       development, and customer support operations. Excluded from scope:

MONTH 10: STAGE 1 AUDIT (Documentation Review)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Purpose:
  Stage 1 audit is a document review to verify that ISMS documentation is
  complete and meets ISO 27001 requirements. No on-site inspection of

  - Is documentation current? (approved within last 12 months)
  - Is documentation consistent? (no contradictions)
  - Is ISMS operating? (evidence of at least 3 months operation)
  - Is organization ready for Stage 2? (controls implemented)

Common Stage 1 Findings:
  ⚠ Policy not approved by management (missing signatures)
  ⚠ Risk assessment incomplete (not all assets identified)
  ⚠ SOA missing justifications (why controls not applicable)
  ⚠ Internal audit not completed
  ⚠ Management review not conducted
  ⚠ Insufficient evidence of ISMS operation (<3 months)

Preparation Checklist:

  □ Presentation prepared (ISMS overview for auditor)

Stage 1 Outcome:
  ✓ PASS: Minor findings, cleared for Stage 2 (typical)
  ⚠ CONDITIONAL PASS: Findings must be addressed before Stage 2
  ✗ FAIL: Major gaps, not ready for Stage 2 (rare if well-prepared)

Post-Stage 1 Actions:
  1. Review auditor findings
  2. Address all findings (2-4 weeks)
  3. Provide evidence of corrective actions
  4. Schedule Stage 2 audit (1-2 months after Stage 1)

Deliverable: Stage 1 audit report (from certification body)

Effort: 40 hours (preparation + audit participation)
Cost: Included in certification body fee ($25k-$40k total)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MONTH 11: STAGE 2 AUDIT (On-Site Assessment)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Purpose:
  Stage 2 audit is a comprehensive on-site assessment to verify that controls
  are implemented and operating effectively. Auditor will interview staff,
  observe processes, and test controls.

Duration: 3-5 days (depends on organization size and complexity)
Location: On-site or remote (many done remotely post-COVID)
Team Size: 1-2 lead auditors + technical experts (if needed)

Audit Methodology:

  - Process observation (watch controls in action)
  - Document review (policies, procedures, evidence)
  - Technical testing (sample testing of controls)
  - System inspection (view configurations, logs, access controls)

Day-by-Day Schedule (Example):

    - 1:00 PM: Auditor deliberation (findings discussion)
    - 3:00 PM: Closing meeting (present findings)

Sample Testing Examples:
  - Select 10 access requests → verify approval before access granted
  - Select 5 terminations → verify access removed within 24 hours
  - Select 10 changes → verify change approval and testing
  - Review 3 incidents → verify followed incident response procedure
  - Inspect CloudTrail logs → verify 1-year retention
  - Check encryption status → verify all S3 buckets encrypted

Interview Questions (Examples):
  "How do you ensure that access is approved before being granted?"
  "What is the process for responding to a security incident?"
  "How often do you review user access rights?"
  "How do you ensure backups can be restored?"
  "What happens if a vulnerability is discovered?"

Findings Types:
  - Major Non-Conformity: Serious gap, control not implemented
    → Must be fixed before certification issued
  - Minor Non-Conformity: Control implemented but evidence of occasional lapse
    → Must be fixed within defined timeframe (typically 90 days)
  - Observation: Opportunity for improvement, not a failure
    → Optional to address

Typical Findings (Even in Well-Prepared Organizations):
  ⚠ Minor: One quarterly access review missed due to scheduling
  ⚠ Minor: Backup restoration not tested in Q4 (only tested Q1-Q3)
  ⚠ Observation: Consider implementing SIEM for enhanced monitoring

Stage 2 Outcome:
  ✓ RECOMMENDED FOR CERTIFICATION: Zero major findings, minors acceptable
  ⚠ CONDITIONAL: Major finding(s) must be remediated
  ✗ NOT RECOMMENDED: Multiple major findings (rare)

Post-Stage 2 Actions:
  1. Review Stage 2 audit report
  2. Address all findings (typically 30-90 days)
  3. Provide evidence of corrective actions to auditor
  4. Auditor reviews corrective actions
  5. Certification decision made

Deliverable: Stage 2 audit report with recommendation
