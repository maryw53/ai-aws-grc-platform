Justification Date: January 2024

Control Objective:
  To prevent unauthorized physical access, damage, and interference to the
  organization's information and other associated assets.

Justification for Non-Applicability:
  Your Company operates a cloud-only infrastructure with no owned or leased
  data centers. All production infrastructure is hosted on AWS, which maintains
  physical security controls and provides ISO 27001 and SOC 2 attestations.

  Office Locations:
    - Corporate office (50 employees): Shared office space with landlord-
      managed physical security (badge access, security cameras, reception)
    - Remote workforce (92 employees): Home offices, no company-controlled
      physical security

  Physical security for AWS infrastructure is inherited from AWS. Evidence:
    - AWS ISO 27001 certificate (Annex A.7.1 covered)
    - AWS SOC 2 Type II report (physical security controls tested)
    - Shared Responsibility Matrix documents customer vs AWS responsibilities

  Corporate office physical security managed by building management, not in
  scope for ISMS (no customer data processed or stored in office).

Alternative Controls:
  - All customer data encrypted at rest (AWS infrastructure)
  - No local data storage policies (data must remain in cloud)
  - Device encryption required (corporate laptops)
  - Remote wipe capability (all company devices)

Evidence:
  - AWS compliance documents (ISO 27001, SOC 2)
  - Cloud-only architecture documentation
  - No Local Data Storage policy
  - Device encryption enforcement (MDM reports)

Risk Assessment:
  - Risk of physical breach: LOW (no data centers, cloud-only)
  - Residual risk from AWS: ACCEPTED (AWS maintains physical controls)

Approved By: CISO
Review Frequency: Annually (or if infrastructure changes)

Cross-Reference:
  - AWS responsibility: Physical and environmental security
  - Customer responsibility: Data encryption, access management
