# HIPAA Security Rule Evidence Checklist

Generate a comprehensive evidence request list for HIPAA Security Rule compliance, organized by safeguard category. Suitable for audits, readiness assessments, or OCR desk audit preparation.

> **Never commit evidence artifacts to source control.** Evidence outputs may include real patient information, access logs, and security configurations that contain or reference ePHI. `.gitignore` covers `evidence/` by default so `git add -A` will not sweep it up, but durable storage is your responsibility. Use an encrypted, access-controlled evidence locker with appropriate safeguards per §164.312(a)(2)(iv).

## Usage

```bash
/us-hipaa-security:evidence-checklist [--category=<cat>] [--format=<fmt>] [--audience=<aud>]

## Evidence Collection by Format

### For Auditors (External/OCR)

Provide organized evidence package with:

1. **Cover Letter**: Organization overview, assessment scope, point of contact
2. **Table of Contents**: Evidence index with CFR references
3. **Executive Summary**: Security Rule compliance status, key gaps, remediation timeline
4. **Detailed Evidence Sections**: Grouped by safeguard category
5. **Gap Analysis**: Findings with CFR section, severity, remediation plan
6. **Attachments**: All supporting documentation

### For Internal Readiness

Simplified checklist format:

- [ ] Risk analysis completed and updated
- [ ] All BAAs signed and current
- [ ] Security training current for all staff
- [ ] Access controls implemented (unique IDs, least privilege)
- [ ] Audit logging enabled and reviewed regularly
- [ ] Contingency plan tested in last 12 months
- [ ] Encryption implemented where addressable and reasonable
- [ ] Policies reviewed and updated
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented
- [ ] Physical security controls in place

## Automated Evidence Collection

### Cloud Infrastructure Evidence

**AWS - S3 Bucket Encryption Check**:
```bash
# Check if S3 buckets containing ePHI have encryption enabled
aws s3api list-buckets --output json | jq -r '.Buckets[].Name' | while read bucket; do
  encryption=$(aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket "$bucket" 2>&1)
  if echo "$encryption" | grep -q "ServerSideEncryptionConfigurationNotFoundError"; then
    echo "$bucket,NOT ENCRYPTED" >> evidence/hipaa-s3-encryption-$(date +%Y%m%d).csv
  else
    echo "$bucket,ENCRYPTED" >> evidence/hipaa-s3-encryption-$(date +%Y%m%d).csv
  fi
done
```

**AWS - RDS Encryption Check**:
```bash
# Check if RDS databases containing ePHI are encrypted
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,StorageEncrypted]' \
  --output json > evidence/hipaa-rds-encryption-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

**AWS - CloudTrail Logging Check**:
```bash
# Verify CloudTrail is logging ePHI-affecting AWS account activity
aws cloudtrail describe-trails --query 'trailList[?IsMultiRegionTrail==`true`]' \
  --output json > evidence/hipaa-cloudtrail-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

### On-Premises Evidence

**Active Directory - User Account Review**:
```powershell
# Export Active Directory users with ePHI system access
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties LastLogonDate,Enabled |
  Where-Object {$_.MemberOf -like "*ePHI-Access*"} |
  Select-Object Name,Enabled,LastLogonDate |
  Export-Csv -Path "evidence/hipaa-ad-users-$(Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd).csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

**SQL Server - Audit Log Export**:
```sql
-- Export audit logs from SQL Server databases containing ePHI
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_audit_log
WHERE event_time > DATEADD(day, -90, GETDATE())
ORDER BY event_time DESC;
```

## Evidence Retention Requirements

**6-Year Retention** (§164.316(b)(2)):

- Retain from date of creation OR date last in effect (whichever is later)
- Applies to all Security Rule policies and procedures
- Includes risk analyses, BAAs, incident logs, training records, evaluation reports
