#### Control 3: Data Protection

**Why It Matters**: Data is the crown jewels. Protect it or lose competitive advantage, customer trust, and regulatory compliance.

**Data Lifecycle**:

1. **Creation**: How data enters the organization
2. **Storage**: Where data resides (databases, file shares, cloud)
3. **Use**: How data is accessed and processed
4. **Sharing**: Internal and external data transmission
5. **Archive**: Long-term retention
6. **Destruction**: Secure disposal

**Key Safeguards**:

- **3.1**: Data management process
- **3.2**: Data inventory (what sensitive data exists, where)
- **3.3**: Data access control lists (least privilege)
- **3.4**: Data retention policy and enforcement
- **3.5**: Secure data disposal (wiping, destruction)
- **3.6 (IG2)**: Encrypt data on end-user devices (full disk encryption)

- **Cloud**: Delete + verify (ensure backups and snapshots deleted)
- **Certificates of destruction**: For regulated industries

---

#### Control 4: Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software

**Why It Matters**: Default configurations are insecure. Attackers exploit well-known weaknesses.

**Configuration Management Principles**:

1. **Least Functionality**: Disable unnecessary services, features, protocols
2. **Secure Defaults**: Harden before deployment (not after)
3. **Consistency**: Standard baselines for asset types
4. **Automation**: Configuration-as-code (Infrastructure as Code)
5. **Validation**: Regular audits and drift detection

**Key Safeguards**:

- **4.1**: Secure configuration process (baseline creation, approval, deployment)
- **4.2**: Secure configuration baselines (documented standards)
- **4.3**: Automatic session locking (screen lock after inactivity)
- **4.4**: Implement and manage firewalls (host-based firewalls enabled)
- **4.5 (IG2)**: Implement DMZ (demilitarized zone for internet-facing systems)
- **4.7**: Manage default accounts (disable or rename, change passwords)
- **4.8 (IG2)**: Uninstall or disable unnecessary services (reduce attack surface)

**Hardening Resources**:

- **CIS Benchmarks**: Free, consensus-developed standards (150+ benchmarks)
  - Operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)
  - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - Applications (web servers, databases, containers)
  - Network devices (Cisco, Palo Alto)
- **DISA STIGs**: Security Technical Implementation Guides (DoD standard)
- **Vendor Hardening Guides**: Microsoft Security Baselines, Red Hat Security Guide

---

#### Control 5: Account Management

**Why It Matters**: Accounts are the keys to the kingdom. Poor account hygiene = easy lateral movement for attackers.

**Account Types**:

- **Standard User Accounts**: Day-to-day work, limited privileges
- **Privileged Accounts**: Administrator, root, domain admin
- **Service Accounts**: Application/service authentication
- **Shared Accounts**: (Avoid! If necessary, tightly control and log)
- **Emergency Access Accounts**: Break-glass for emergencies

**Key Safeguards**:

- **5.1**: Account inventory (all user, admin, service accounts)
- **5.2**: Use unique passwords (no shared passwords)
- **5.3**: Disable dormant accounts (inactive 45-90 days)
- **5.4**: Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated accounts (separate admin and user accounts)
- **5.5 (IG2)**: Establish and maintain MFA (all users, especially admins)
- **5.6 (IG2)**: Centralize account management (SSO, directory services)

**Privileged Account Best Practices**:

- **Separate Accounts**: User account for email/browsing, admin account for administration
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access**: Temporary privilege elevation, time-boxed
- **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)**: Dedicated hardened systems for admin tasks (IG3)
- **Session Recording**: Record admin sessions for audit
- **Password Vaulting**: Store privileged credentials in vault (CyberArk, HashiCorp Vault, Keeper)

**Service Account Management**:

- Least privilege (only permissions needed)
- Unique per service (not shared across apps)
- Strong, randomly generated passwords (32+ characters)
- Regular password rotation (90-180 days, or eliminate with Managed Service Identities)
- Avoid interactive login rights

**Dormant Account Detection**:

- Last login date tracking
- Automated alerts after 30 days inactive
- Disable after 45-60 days inactive
- Delete after 90-120 days (or per retention policy)

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:

- **Something you know**: Password, PIN
- **Something you have**: Hardware token (YubiKey, RSA SecurID), mobile app (Duo, Authenticator)
- **Something you are**: Biometrics (fingerprint, face, iris)

**MFA Strength Hierarchy** (strongest to weakest):

1. **FIDO2/WebAuthn** (hardware security keys, phishing-resistant)
2. **Certificate-based authentication** (PIV/CAC smart cards)
3. **Authenticator app with push notification** (Duo, Microsoft Authenticator)
4. **Time-based one-time password (TOTP)** (Google Authenticator, Authy)
5. **SMS/voice call** (weak, susceptible to SIM swapping - avoid if possible)

**Account Lifecycle**:

1. **Provisioning**: Manager request, HR approval, role-based access
2. **Modification**: Role changes, promotions, transfers
3. **Review**: Quarterly access reviews, recertification
4. **Deprovisioning**: Immediate upon termination, documented process

---

#### Control 6: Access Control Management

**Why It Matters**: Principle of least privilege prevents lateral movement and limits blast radius.

**Access Control Models**:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access based on job function
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access based on attributes (department, clearance, location)
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: System-enforced, label-based (government/military)
- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Owner controls access (traditional file permissions)

**Key Safeguards**:

- **6.1**: Access granting process (documented, approved)
- **6.2**: Access revoking process (terminations, role changes)
- **6.3**: Require MFA for externally-exposed applications
- **6.4**: Require MFA for remote access
- **6.5 (IG2)**: Require MFA for administrative access
- **6.7 (IG2)**: Centralize access control (single authoritative source)
- **6.8 (IG2)**: Define and maintain RBAC (standardized roles)

**RBAC Implementation**:

- Define roles based on job functions (not individuals)
- Group permissions into roles (Finance-User, HR-Admin, Developer)
- Assign users to roles (not direct permissions)
- Regular role reviews and updates

**Least Privilege Principles**:

- Default deny (no access unless explicitly granted)
- Need-to-know basis
- Time-limited access (expire elevated access)
- Minimal effective permissions
- Separation of duties (no single person has end-to-end control)

**Remote Access Security**:

- VPN required (no direct internet exposure of internal resources)
- MFA for VPN access
- Split-tunnel vs full-tunnel (consider data sensitivity)
- Device posture checking (Endpoint compliance before access)
- Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) for modern approach

**Access Review Process**:

- Quarterly manager reviews of team access
- Annual comprehensive access recertification
- Automated alerts for dormant permissions
- Immediate revocation upon termination
- Audit trail of access changes
