# CSA CCM Assessment

Evaluates organizational readiness for Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) compliance.

## Arguments

- `$1` - Assessment scope (required: full, domain-specific, service-model)
- `$2` - Cloud service model (optional: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, hybrid)

## CSA CCM Overview

**Purpose**: Provide cloud-specific security controls framework
**Current Version**: CCM v4.0 (197 control objectives)
**Domains**: 17 security domains
**Use Cases**: Cloud provider assessments, cloud security posture, multi-framework compliance

## Cloud Service Models

| Model | Description | Provider Responsibility | Consumer Responsibility |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **IaaS** | Infrastructure as a Service | Physical infrastructure, network | OS, apps, data, identity |
| **PaaS** | Platform as a Service | Infrastructure + OS + runtime | Applications, data |
| **SaaS** | Software as a Service | Full stack | Data, access management |
| **Hybrid** | Mixed deployment | Shared based on architecture | Shared based on architecture |

## Assessment Output

1. **Overall CCM Readiness**: Compliance percentage across 197 controls
2. **Domain Maturity Scores**: Breakdown by 17 domains
3. **Service Model Gaps**: IaaS/PaaS/SaaS specific deficiencies
4. **Shared Responsibility Analysis**: Provider vs. customer control ownership
5. **Framework Alignment**: Mapping to ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, NIST
6. **CAIQ Readiness**: Preparation for Consensus Assessments
7. **Remediation Roadmap**: Prioritized action plan by domain

## Shared Responsibility Model

### IaaS Example Controls

- **Customer**: OS hardening, application security, data encryption, IAM
- **Provider**: Physical security, network infrastructure, hypervisor

### PaaS Example Controls

- **Customer**: Application code security, data protection, user access
- **Provider**: OS patching, runtime security, platform infrastructure

### SaaS Example Controls

- **Customer**: User management, data classification, access policies
- **Provider**: Application security, infrastructure, encryption, logging

## Framework Mapping

CCM maps to major compliance frameworks:

- **ISO 27001/27002**: Information security management
- **SOC 2**: Trust Services Criteria
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card security
- **NIST CSF/800-53**: Federal security standards
- **GDPR**: Privacy and data protection
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare security

## Assessment Types

### Full Assessment

- All 197 controls across 17 domains
- Complete control implementation review
- Evidence collection and validation
- Comprehensive gap analysis

### Domain-Specific Assessment

- Focus on specific domain (e.g., CEK, IAM, LOG)
- Deep dive into domain controls
- Targeted remediation planning

### Service Model Assessment

- Tailored to IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS deployment
- Shared responsibility analysis
- Model-specific control applicability

## Examples

```bash
# Full CCM assessment for SaaS provider
/ccm:assess full SaaS

# Domain-specific assessment for encryption
/ccm:assess domain-specific CEK

# IaaS cloud infrastructure assessment
/ccm:assess full IaaS

# Hybrid cloud environment assessment
/ccm:assess full hybrid
```

## CAIQ Integration

Assessment prepares organization for CSA CAIQ (Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire):

- Self-assessment questionnaire
- 197 yes/no questions aligned to CCM
- Publicly sharable security posture
- Customer due diligence tool
