## Response Best Practices

### Complete Evidence Requirements

**For "Yes" Responses**:

1. **Policy Reference**: Name of policy/procedure
2. **Implementation Details**: How control is technically implemented
3. **Responsible Party**: Team/role accountable
4. **Supporting Evidence**: Certifications, audit reports, tool screenshots
5. **Frequency**: How often control is performed/reviewed

**For "No" Responses**:

1. **Explanation**: Why control is not implemented
2. **Compensating Controls**: Alternative measures in place
3. **Roadmap**: Plans to implement (if applicable)
4. **Risk Acceptance**: Documented decision not to implement (if applicable)

### Example Response (CEK-01: Encryption at Rest)

**Question**: Is data encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms?

**Answer**: Yes

**Evidence**:
"All customer data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Encryption is implemented using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) with customer-managed keys (CMKs). Database encryption uses Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) on Amazon RDS. File storage in S3 uses server-side encryption (SSE-KMS). Encryption is enforced through AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs) preventing unencrypted resource creation. This control is documented in our Cryptography Policy (v2.1) and verified in our annual SOC 2 Type II audit. Responsible party: Security Engineering team."

## CSA STAR Registry

**CAIQ Use in STAR**:

1. **Level 1 (Self-Assessment)**: Submit completed CAIQ
2. **Level 2 (Certification)**: CAIQ + third-party audit (ISO 27001, SOC 2)
3. **Level 3 (Continuous Monitoring)**: CAIQ + ongoing monitoring

**Public Visibility**: STAR Level 1 and 2 published in CSA STAR Registry for customer transparency

## CAIQ Completion Workflow

1. **Information Gathering** (Week 1-2)
   - Collect policies, procedures, architecture diagrams
   - Identify control owners across teams
   - Gather audit reports and certifications

2. **Response Drafting** (Week 3-5)
   - Answer yes/no questions
   - Draft evidence descriptions
   - Document compensating controls

3. **Internal Review** (Week 6)
   - Legal review (privacy, contracts)
   - Security team validation
   - Executive approval for public disclosure

4. **Finalization** (Week 7-8)
   - Format for chosen output
   - CSA STAR submission (if applicable)
   - Customer distribution

## Common Challenges

1. **Evidence Collection**: Gathering artifacts from multiple teams
2. **Consistency**: Ensuring responses align with audit reports
3. **Public Disclosure**: Balancing transparency with security through obscurity
4. **Maintenance**: Keeping CAIQ current as controls change
5. **Shared Responsibility**: Articulating cloud provider vs. customer responsibilities
