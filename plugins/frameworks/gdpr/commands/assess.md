# GDPR Assessment

Evaluates organizational readiness for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.

## Arguments

- `$1` - Assessment scope (optional: full, data-mapping, rights-management, security-measures)
- `$2` - Organization type (optional: controller, processor, joint-controller)

## GDPR Applicability

**Territorial Scope**:

- Establishment in EU (regardless of processing location)
- Offering goods/services to EU data subjects
- Monitoring behavior of EU data subjects

**Data Subject Rights Territory**:

- EU/EEA countries
- UK (UK GDPR post-Brexit)
- Switzerland (via adequacy decision)

## Assessment Output

1. **Compliance Score**: Overall GDPR readiness percentage
2. **Principle Assessment**: Evaluation against 7 core principles
3. **Lawful Basis Analysis**: Validity of processing bases
4. **Data Subject Rights**: Implementation status of 8 rights
5. **Security Measures**: Technical and organizational safeguards
6. **Accountability**: Documentation and governance gaps
7. **DPO Requirements**: Whether DPO required and compliance status
8. **Cross-Border Transfers**: Transfer mechanism compliance
9. **Breach Readiness**: 72-hour notification capability
10. **Remediation Roadmap**: Prioritized action plan with timelines

## 7 GDPR Principles (Article 5)

| Principle | Description | Key Requirements |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency** | Legal basis, fair processing, clear communication | Privacy notices, consent forms, legitimate interest assessments |
