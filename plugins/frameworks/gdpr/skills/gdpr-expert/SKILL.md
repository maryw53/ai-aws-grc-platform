### 7 Principles of Data Processing (Article 5)

#### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency

**Lawfulness**: Must have lawful basis (Article 6)
**Fairness**: No deceptive, misleading, or detrimental processing
**Transparency**: Clear, plain language communication to data subjects

**Implementation**:

- Privacy notices at collection
- Layered notices (short + full)

**Compatible Processing**:

- Same or closely related purpose
- Consider: Link between purposes, context, nature of data, consequences, safeguards

**Exceptions**:

- Archiving in public interest
- Scientific/historical research
- Statistical purposes

#### 3. Data Minimization

**"Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary"**

**Implementation**:

- Collect only what you need
- Justify each data element
- Regular review and purge
- Limit access (need-to-know)
- Pseudonymization/anonymization where possible

**Common Violations**:

- "Nice to have" data collection
- Speculative future use
- Excessive profiling data

#### 4. Accuracy

**Requirements**:

- Personal data must be accurate
- Kept up to date where necessary
- Inaccurate data erased or rectified

**Implementation**:

- Verification at collection
- Regular reviews and updates
- Easy rectification process
- Notify recipients of changes
- Quality control procedures

#### 5. Storage Limitation

**"Kept no longer than necessary for the purposes"**

**Implementation**:

- With appropriate safeguards

#### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)

**"Appropriate security... including protection against unauthorized/unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage"**

**Implementation**: See Article 32 (Security of Processing)

#### 7. Accountability

**"Controller shall be responsible for and able to demonstrate compliance"**

**Demonstration Requirements**:

- Documentation (policies, procedures, records)
- Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)
- Privacy by Design and Default
- Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)
- Records of Processing Activities
- Training and awareness programs
- Regular audits and reviews
- Incident response and breach records

### 6 Lawful Bases for Processing (Article 6)

**Must identify ONE for each processing purpose**

#### 1. Consent (Article 6(1)(a))

**Requirements**:

- **Freely given**: No coercion, imbalance of power consideration
- **Specific**: Separate consent for separate purposes
- **Informed**: Identity, purposes, data types, rights, withdrawal
- **Unambiguous**: Clear affirmative action (no pre-ticked boxes, silence, inactivity)

**Additional for Consent**:

- Easy to withdraw (as easy as to give)
- Withdrawal does not affect lawfulness of prior processing
- Burden of proof on controller
- Record of consent (who, when, what, how)

**When Problematic**:

- Employment context (power imbalance)
- Public authorities (no free choice)
- Service bundling (cannot refuse)

**Children's Consent** (Article 8):

- Under 16: Parental consent required (Member States can lower to 13)
- Controller must make reasonable efforts to verify

#### 2. Contract (Article 6(1)(b))

**Two scenarios**:

- Processing necessary to **perform a contract** with data subject
- Processing necessary to **enter into contract** (pre-contractual steps)

**"Necessary"**:

- Objectively essential to contract
- Not just "helpful" or "customary"
- Direct relationship to contract performance

**Examples**:

- Shipping address for product delivery
- Credit card for payment processing
- Account credentials for service access

**Not Sufficient**:

- Marketing to customers (use consent or legitimate interests)
- Analytics not integral to service (use legitimate interests)

#### 3. Legal Obligation (Article 6(1)(c))

**Requirements**:

- Processing required by **EU law** or **Member State law**
- Obligation on the controller
- Must identify specific legal provision

**Examples**:

- Tax records (legal retention requirements)
- Employment records (labor law)
- AML/KYC checks (financial regulations)
- Health and safety reporting

**Not Sufficient**:

- Contractual obligations (use contract basis)
- Best practices or industry standards
- Non-EU legal obligations

#### 4. Vital Interests (Article 6(1)(d))

**"Necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another"**

**Scope**:

- Life or death situations
- Serious health threats
- Last resort when other bases not available

**Examples**:

- Emergency medical treatment (unconscious patient)
- Humanitarian crises
- Pandemic response (in some cases)

**Rarely Appropriate**: Most organizations won't use this basis

#### 5. Public Task (Article 6(1)(e))

**"Necessary for task carried out in the public interest or in exercise of official authority"**

**Scope**:

- Public authorities
- Private entities exercising official authority
- Task must have basis in EU/Member State law

**Examples**:

- Government agencies
- Regulators
- Educational institutions (public tasks)

**Not Available**: Commercial organizations (use legitimate interests)

#### 6. Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f))

**"Necessary for purposes of legitimate interests pursued by controller or third party, except where overridden by interests, rights and freedoms of data subject"**

**Three-Part Test**:

1. **Purpose Test**: Is interest legitimate?
2. **Necessity Test**: Is processing necessary?
3. **Balancing Test**: Do data subject's interests override?

**Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA)** Required:

- Identify legitimate interest
- Necessity assessment (no less intrusive means)
- Balancing test (impact on data subjects)
- Document LIA

**Examples of Legitimate Interests**:

- Fraud prevention
- Network and information security
- Direct marketing (subject to right to object)
- Intra-group transfers
- Employee monitoring (limited)
- Analytics for service improvement

**Cannot Use**:

- Public authorities (for official tasks)
- When data subject's interests clearly override

**Right to Object** (Article 21):

- Data subjects can object to legitimate interests processing
- Controller must demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds to continue

### Special Category Data (Article 9)

**General Prohibition**: Processing of special categories prohibited
