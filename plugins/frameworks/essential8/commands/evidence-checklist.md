# Essential Eight Evidence Checklist

Generates comprehensive evidence collection checklists for Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Essential Eight mitigation strategies with maturity level progression (ML1-ML3).

> **Never commit evidence artifacts to source control.** The outputs below include real usernames, credential reports, MFA device states, and privileged-account inventories. `.gitignore` covers `evidence/` by default so `git add -A` will not sweep it up, but durable storage is your responsibility. Use an encrypted, access-controlled evidence locker (encrypted S3 with least-privilege IAM, a GRC platform, or a shared drive with full-disk encryption and MFA-gated access).

## Usage

```bash
/essential8:evidence-checklist <strategy> [--maturity-level <1|2|3>] [--export <format>]
```

## Arguments

- `<strategy>`: Essential Eight strategy number (e.g., "1", "2", "3") or name (e.g., "Application Control", "Patch Applications")
- `--maturity-level`: Target maturity level (1, 2, or 3). Default: `3`
- `--export`: Export format (`json`, `csv`, `markdown`). Default: `markdown`

## Example: Application Control Evidence (Maturity Level 3)

```bash
/essential8:evidence-checklist 1 --maturity-level 3
```

**Output:**

Essential Eight Evidence Checklist
Strategy: #1 - Application Control
Maturity Level: ML3 (Target)
ACSC Guidance: ISM Control ASD-0843, ASD-1490-1507
Assessment Framework: ACSC Essential Eight Maturity Model (June 2024)

## Strategy Description

Application control is implemented on workstations and internet-facing servers to prevent execution of unapproved/malicious programs including .exe, DLL, scripts (e.g., Windows Script Host, PowerShell), installers, compiled HTML, HTML applications and drivers.

## Maturity Level Progression

### ML1 (Baseline)
- Application control implemented on workstations
- Microsoft's "recommended block rules" or equivalent

### ML2 (Improved)
- Application control on workstations and internet-facing servers
- Microsoft's "recommended block rules" + "recommended driver block rules"
- Validated at least annually

### ML3 (Advanced) - TARGET
- ML2 + validation at least every six months
- Application control events logged and centrally captured
- Cryptographic hash validation (not path-based rules)
- Incident response process for blocked applications

# index=windows sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker*" EventCode=8004 OR EventCode=8007
# | stats count by host, UserName
# | outputcsv evidence/e8-1-splunk-blocks-YYYYMMDD.csv
```

Collection Frequency: Monthly summary report
Retention: 18 months
Purpose: Centralized logging (ML3 requirement)

✓ **Application Control Coverage (Endpoint Inventory)**

```powershell
# Query all endpoints for AppLocker/WDAC status via AD
# Requires remote WinRM access

$computers = Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties OperatingSystem |
    Where-Object { $_.OperatingSystem -like "*Windows*" }

$results = @()
foreach ($computer in $computers) {
    try {
        $session = New-PSSession -ComputerName $computer.Name -ErrorAction Stop

        $appLockerStatus = Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock {
            $policy = Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
            return @{
                ComputerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
                AppLockerEnabled = ($policy -ne $null)
                RuleCount = ($policy.RuleCollections | Measure-Object).Count
                EnforcementMode = ($policy.RuleCollections[0].EnforcementMode)
            }
        }

        $results += New-Object PSObject -Property $appLockerStatus
        Remove-PSSession -Session $session
    }
    catch {
        $results += [PSCustomObject]@{
            ComputerName = $computer.Name
            AppLockerEnabled = "ERROR: Could not connect"
        }
    }
}

$results | Export-Csv "evidence/e8-1-endpoint-coverage-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').csv" -NoTypeInformation

# Calculate coverage percentage
$total = ($results | Measure-Object).Count
$enabled = ($results | Where-Object { $_.AppLockerEnabled -eq $true } | Measure-Object).Count
Write-Host "Application Control Coverage: $enabled / $total ($([math]::Round($enabled/$total*100,2))%)"
```

Collection Frequency: Monthly
Retention: 18 months
Purpose: Coverage assessment (should be 100% for ML3)

✓ **Hash-Based Rules Evidence**

```powershell
# Verify rules use cryptographic hashes (not just path/publisher)
$policy = Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective

$hashRules = $policy.RuleCollections | Where-Object { $_.RuleCollectionType -eq "Exe" } |
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty Rules |
    Where-Object { $_.GetType().Name -eq "FileHashRule" }

$publisherRules = $policy.RuleCollections | Where-Object { $_.RuleCollectionType -eq "Exe" } |
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty Rules |
    Where-Object { $_.GetType().Name -eq "FilePublisherRule" }

$pathRules = $policy.RuleCollections | Where-Object { $_.RuleCollectionType -eq "Exe" } |
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty Rules |
    Where-Object { $_.GetType().Name -eq "FilePathRule" }

# Export rule type breakdown
[PSCustomObject]@{
    HashRules = ($hashRules | Measure-Object).Count
    PublisherRules = ($publisherRules | Measure-Object).Count
    PathRules = ($pathRules | Measure-Object).Count
    Date = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"
} | Export-Csv "evidence/e8-1-rule-types-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').csv" -NoTypeInformation

# For ML3: Hash rules should be >80% of total rules
```

## Maturity Level Assessment Criteria

### ML1 Assessment (Baseline)

✓ Application control implemented on workstations
✓ Microsoft's recommended block rules configured
✓ Policy documented

**Typical Gaps:**

- No coverage on servers
- Path-based rules instead of hash-based
- No validation process

### ML2 Assessment (Improved)

✓ ML1 + application control on internet-facing servers
✓ Microsoft's recommended driver block rules
✓ Annual validation performed
✓ Exceptions documented and approved

**Typical Gaps:**

- Validation only annual (not every 6 months)
- Centralized logging not implemented
- Incident response process undefined

### ML3 Assessment (Advanced) - ACSC Target

✓ ML2 + validation every 6 months
✓ Application control events logged centrally (SIEM)
✓ Cryptographic hash validation for >80% of rules
✓ Incident response process for blocked applications
✓ 100% coverage of in-scope systems

**Evidence Required:**

- 2 validation reports per year
- Central SIEM logs showing AppLocker/WDAC events
- Hash-based rules evidence
- Incident response process documentation
- Coverage reports showing 100%

## Common Assessment Findings

### Critical (Likely to be rated ML0 or ML1)

❌ No application control implemented
❌ Application control in audit mode only (not enforcing)
❌ Coverage <50% of workstations
❌ No policy documentation

### Moderate (Likely to be rated ML1 or ML2)

⚠️ No application control on internet-facing servers
⚠️ Path-based rules only (no hash validation)
⚠️ Validation not performed in last 12 months
⚠️ Events not centrally logged

### Minor (ML2 or ML3 with improvements needed)

⚠️ Validation every 12 months (need 6 months for ML3)
⚠️ Some hash-based rules but <80%
⚠️ Centralized logging exists but retention <18 months
⚠️ Incident response process informal (not documented)

## Remediation Guidance

### If No Application Control Exists

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Planning**
   - Select technology (AppLocker for Windows 10+, WDAC for Windows 11)
   - Identify all workstations and internet-facing servers
   - Create initial whitelist (scan existing approved applications)

2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Pilot**
   - Deploy AppLocker in AUDIT mode to 10% of workstations
   - Monitor audit logs for 2 weeks
   - Refine whitelist based on audit logs
   - Create exception request process

3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Rollout**
   - Deploy to 50% of workstations in AUDIT mode
   - After 2 weeks, switch to ENFORCE mode
   - Deploy to remaining 50%
   - Deploy to internet-facing servers (carefully!)

4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): Mature**
   - Configure centralized logging (WEF or SIEM)
   - Migrate path rules to hash rules
   - Schedule 6-monthly validation reviews
   - Document incident response process

**Timeline**: 4-6 months to reach ML3

### If Application Control is Audit-Only

1. Review audit logs for last 30 days
2. Add commonly-used applications to whitelist (if appropriate)
3. Educate users on exception request process
4. Schedule change window to switch to ENFORCE mode
5. Monitor help desk tickets for 2 weeks
6. Adjust whitelist based on legitimate exceptions

**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks

### If No Centralized Logging

1. **Windows Event Forwarding (Free)**
   - Configure WEF collector server
   - Create GPO to forward AppLocker events
   - Test with pilot group
   - Roll out to all endpoints

2. **SIEM Integration (Recommended for ML3)**
   - Configure Splunk/ELK/Azure Sentinel connector
   - Ingest AppLocker event logs
   - Create dashboards and alerts
   - Set retention to 18 months

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks

## Cross-References

### Related Essential Eight Strategies

- #2 - Patch Applications (approved applications must be patched)
- #3 - Configure Microsoft Office Macro Settings (AppLocker can block macros)
- #4 - User Application Hardening (web browsers are approved applications)
- #7 - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA for exception approvals)

### Maps to Other Frameworks

- **NIST 800-53**: CM-7 (Least Functionality), SI-7 (Software Integrity)
- **ISO 27001:2022**: A.8.19 (Installation of software on operational systems)
- **CMMC 2.0**: CM.L2-3.4.7 (Least functionality)
- **CIS Controls v8**: 2.3 (Allowlisting)

- Planning and policy development: 40 hours ($4,000)
- Pilot deployment: 40 hours ($4,000)
- Full deployment: 80 hours ($8,000)
- **Total ML1**: ~$16k

### ML2 Implementation (from ML1)

- Server deployment: 40 hours ($4,000)
- Driver block rules: 16 hours ($1,600)
- Annual validation: 24 hours/year ($2,400/year)
- **Additional for ML2**: ~$8k

### ML3 Implementation (from ML2)

- Centralized logging (SIEM): 80 hours + $10k-$50k SIEM ($18k-$58k)
- Hash rule migration: 40 hours ($4,000)
- Incident response process: 24 hours ($2,400)
- Semi-annual validation: 24 hours x2/year ($4,800/year)
- **Additional for ML3**: ~$29k-$69k
