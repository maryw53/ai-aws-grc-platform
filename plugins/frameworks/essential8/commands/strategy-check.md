## Examples

```bash
# Check Application Control implementation at ML2
/essential8:strategy-check 1 2

# Verify MFA strategy at ML3
/essential8:strategy-check "Multi-Factor Authentication" 3

# Assess Patch Applications maturity
/essential8:strategy-check 2

# Review Regular Backups implementation
/essential8:strategy-check 8 1
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Application Control**: Allowing execution from user-writable locations
2. **Patching**: Not treating extreme risk as truly urgent (48 hours)
3. **Office Macros**: Trusting macros from email attachments
4. **Hardening**: Not keeping pace with application updates
5. **Admin Privileges**: Shared admin accounts, no logging
6. **OS Patching**: Skipping testing, causing production issues
7. **MFA**: SMS-based MFA at ML3 (not phishing-resistant)
8. **Backups**: Not testing restoration, backups accessible to malware
