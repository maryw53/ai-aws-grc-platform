# CCCS Assessment Guidance

Guidance on the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) cloud security assessment process and certified cloud service providers.

## Arguments

- `$1` - Topic (optional: process, providers, requirements) - defaults to "process"

## CCCS Assessment Process

### ITSM.50.100 Cloud Security Assessment

The CCCS assesses cloud service providers against the ITSP.50.103 Cloud Security Categorization framework.

**Assessment Tiers**:

- **Tier 1**: Self-assessment by CSP
- **Tier 2**: Independent third-party assessment
- **Tier 3**: CCCS assessment (for Protected B and above)

### Protected B Assessment Steps

#### 1. Pre-Assessment (1-2 months)

**Organization Activities**:

- Review ITSG-33 security controls
- Implement PBMM controls (10 required controls)
- Document security policies and procedures
- Prepare System Security Plan (SSP)
- Conduct internal audit

**Required Documentation**:

- System Security Plan (SSP)
- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
- Security Assessment Report (SAR)
- Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)
- Incident Response Plan
- Contingency Plan

#### 2. Application Submission (1 month)

**Submission to CCCS**:

- Complete assessment application
- Submit documentation package
- Provide cloud service description
- Identify Canadian regions used
- Demonstrate data residency controls

**CCCS Review**:

- Documentation completeness check
- Initial risk assessment
- Assessment schedule determination

#### 3. Assessment Execution (2-4 months)

**Assessment Activities**:

- Document review and analysis
- Configuration review of cloud environment
- Security control testing (10 PBMM controls)
- Vulnerability assessment
- Penetration testing (if required)
- Interviews with personnel

**Evidence Requirements**:

- Configuration screenshots
- Log samples (2-year retention proof)
- Encryption validation (FIPS 140-2)
- Data residency verification
- Access control demonstrations
- Incident response procedures

#### 4. Remediation (1-3 months)

**For Identified Gaps**:

- CCCS provides findings report
- Organization develops remediation plan
- Implement corrective actions
- Re-assessment of remediated controls

**POA&M**:

- Document residual risks
- Establish remediation timelines
- Assign responsible parties
- Track to completion

#### 5. Certification (1 month)

**CCCS Deliverables**:

- Security Assessment Report (SAR)
- Authorization to Operate (ATO)
- Continuous monitoring requirements
- Re-assessment schedule

**Validity Period**: 2 years (re-assessment required)

| **Third-party assessment** | $100,000 - $250,000 | CCCS Tier 2 assessment |
| **Remediation** | $50,000 - $200,000 | Depends on gaps |
| **CCCS assessment fee** | Varies | For Tier 3 assessments |
| **Annual maintenance** | $25,000 - $75,000 | Continuous monitoring |
| **Re-assessment (2 years)** | $75,000 - $150,000 | Reduced scope |
