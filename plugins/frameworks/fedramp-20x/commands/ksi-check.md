Evaluates compliance with FedRAMP 20X Key Security Indicators.

## Arguments

- `$1` - KSI category (optional, defaults to all)
- `$2` - Evidence path (optional)

## KSI Categories

| Code | Category | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|

## 20X Approach

FedRAMP 20X emphasizes:

- **Automated validation** over manual assessment
- **Continuous monitoring** over point-in-time audits
- **Machine-readable policies** over PDF documents
- **Evidence automation** over manual collection

## Output

- KSI compliance status by category
- Automation readiness assessment
- Gap analysis against 20X requirements
- Integration recommendations

## Example

```bash
/fedramp-20x:ksi-check IAM
/fedramp-20x:ksi-check all ./evidence/
```
