# HITRUST Expert

Deep expertise in HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) for healthcare and business-associate organizations.

> **Important — normative text.** HITRUST CSF is proprietary and subscription-required. This skill provides **implementation guidance**, **assessment workflow**, and **evidence patterns** — phrased in the author's own words. All normative control statements, scoring rubrics, and MyCSF-specific requirement language must be read from your licensed CSF. When a command in this plugin quotes a control description, it is a paraphrased summary; consult the CSF for authoritative text.

## Expertise Areas

### HITRUST Alliance Overview

**Mission**: Create security and privacy programs that can be certified
