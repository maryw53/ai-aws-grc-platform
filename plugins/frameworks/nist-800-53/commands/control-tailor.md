# NIST 800-53 Control Tailoring

Provides interactive control tailoring guidance for NIST 800-53 baselines, helping organizations customize controls based on risk assessment, operational requirements, and technology constraints while maintaining compliance.

## Usage

```bash
/nist:control-tailor <control-id> <baseline> [options]
```

## Arguments

- `$1` - Control ID (e.g., "AC-2", "AU-2", "SC-7") or family (e.g., "AC", "AU")
- `$2` - Baseline: "low", "moderate", "high", "privacy"
- `$3` - Options (optional): `--environment=cloud|hybrid|on-prem`, `--output=guidance|ssp-text|yaml`

## Examples

```bash
# Tailor single control for moderate baseline
/nist:control-tailor AC-2 moderate

# Tailor control for cloud environment
/nist:control-tailor AC-2 moderate --environment=cloud

# Tailor entire control family
/nist:control-tailor AC moderate

# Generate SSP-ready text
/nist:control-tailor SC-7 high --output=ssp-text

              and IAM roles for services, reducing account sprawl.

[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
TAILORED TO:
  - Standard accounts: Direct manager approval
  - Privileged accounts: CISO approval + manager approval
  - Service accounts: Application owner + Security team approval
  - Emergency accounts: CISO approval only

JUSTIFICATION: Aligns with organizational structure and risk tolerance.

[Assignment: organization-defined procedures or conditions]
TAILORED TO:
  - Automated provisioning via Okta/AWS SSO upon manager approval
  - Automated deprovisioning within 4 hours of HR termination
  - Quarterly access reviews by resource owners

[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
TAILORED TO:
  - Quarterly reviews for all accounts (PCI requirement)
  - Monthly reviews for privileged accounts
  - Daily automated checks for inactive accounts (>90 days)

JUSTIFICATION: More restrictive than annual baseline requirement due to

TAILORED CONTROL STATEMENT (SSP-Ready)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What Responsible: Information Security, IT Operations
What Implemented: January 2024

AC-2: Account Management

Your Company manages information system accounts through automated provisioning
integrated with our HR system (BambooHR) and identity provider (Okta). The
organization maintains the following account types:

  a. Account Types:
     - Workforce accounts (federated via Okta to AWS SSO)
     - Service accounts (AWS IAM roles for applications)
     - Emergency access accounts (break-glass, disabled by default, max 72 hours)
     - Contractor accounts (temporary, max 6 months)

  b. Account managers are assigned based on organizational structure:
     - IT Operations manages workforce accounts
     - Application teams manage service accounts
     - CISO manages emergency access accounts

  c. Group and role membership is established based on job function using role-based
     access control (RBAC). Roles are documented in the Access Control Policy v1.8.

  d. Authorized users, group membership, and privileges are specified in Okta and
     automatically synchronized to AWS SSO. Access authorizations are documented
     in access request tickets (Jira Service Desk).

  e. Account creation approvals:
     - Standard accounts: Direct manager approval via Jira
     - Privileged accounts: Manager + CISO approval
     - Service accounts: Application owner + Security team approval

  f. Account lifecycle is managed through automated workflows:
     - Creation: Okta webhook triggers AWS SSO provisioning
     - Modification: Jira approval workflow + automated update
     - Disable: Automated within 4 hours of HR termination event
     - Removal: 90 days after disable (after verification)

  g. Account usage is monitored through:
     - CloudTrail (all IAM API activity)
     - GuardDuty (anomaly detection)
     - Daily credential report analysis (inactive accounts)

  h. Account managers are notified automatically:
     - HR termination event triggers immediate Slack/email notification
     - Quarterly access review lists include account manager
     - Inactive account warnings sent to managers 7 days before disable

  i. Access authorization is based on:
     - Valid Jira approval ticket
     - HR system confirmation of active employment
     - Okta group membership (synchronized from HR)
     - Least privilege principle (minimum necessary access)

  j. Accounts are reviewed quarterly (every 90 days) by resource owners and
     managers. Privileged accounts are reviewed monthly. Reviews are documented
     and stored in the compliance evidence repository.

  k. Service accounts (shared by nature) have credentials rotated when team
     membership changes. Credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager with
     automatic rotation enabled.

Control Enhancements Implemented:
  - AC-2(1): Automated provisioning/deprovisioning via Okta + Lambda
  - AC-2(2): Automatic disable of emergency accounts after 72 hours
  - AC-2(3): Automated disable of inactive accounts after 90 days
  - AC-2(4): CloudTrail logging of all account management actions
  - AC-2(9): Prohibition of shared user accounts (policy enforced)

Evidence:
  - Access Control Policy v1.8 (approved 2024-01-15)
  - Okta to AWS SSO integration documentation
  - Lambda function: sync-okta-to-sso (source code + logs)
  - Quarterly access review reports (2024-Q1 through Q4)
  - CloudTrail logs (full year, 365-day retention)
  - Jira access request tickets (sample 25)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TESTING AND VALIDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Control Effectiveness Testing:

✓ Design Testing (Point-in-Time):
  - Review Access Control Policy for completeness
  - Verify automated provisioning workflow exists
  - Validate approval matrix (manager, CISO, security)
  - Confirm CloudTrail logging enabled

✓ Operating Effectiveness Testing (Period):
  - Sample 25 access requests: verify approval before access
  - Sample 25 terminations: verify timely deprovisioning (<4 hours)
  - Sample 4 quarterly reviews: verify completeness and sign-off
  - Review CloudTrail logs for unauthorized account changes
  - Test emergency account auto-disable (create test account)
  - Test inactive account detection (check credential report)

Test Commands:
```bash
# Test automated provisioning
/grc-engineer:test-control AC-2

# Validate CloudTrail logging
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=CreateUser

# Check inactive accounts
aws iam generate-credential-report
aws iam get-credential-report

# Verify access reviews exist
ls -l ./evidence/access-reviews/2024-Q*
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COMPENSATING CONTROLS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If Unable to Implement Enhancement:

Cannot implement AC-2(1) - Automated Account Management:
  Compensating Control:
    - Daily manual review of pending access requests
    - HR sends termination list to IT daily (not real-time)
    - Weekly manual review of all active accounts
  Risk Acceptance:
    - Higher risk of delayed deprovisioning
    - Increased manual effort and potential errors
  Approval Required: CISO + Risk Committee

Cannot implement AC-2(3) - Disable Inactive Accounts:
  Compensating Control:
    - Monthly manual review of IAM credential report
    - Manager attestation for inactive accounts (justification)
    - Quarterly verification that attested accounts still need access
  Risk Acceptance:
    - Inactive accounts remain enabled longer
    - Increased attack surface
  Approval Required: CISO

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Immediate Actions:

1. Implement AC-2(1), AC-2(2), AC-2(3), AC-2(4) (core enhancements)
2. Generate IaC for implementation: /soc2:gap-to-code gaps.json aws
3. Document tailoring decisions in SSP
4. Update Access Control Policy with tailored parameters

Within 3 Months:

1. Consider AC-2(9) if shared accounts still exist
2. Evaluate AC-2(12) for enhanced monitoring
3. Review if AC-2(7) needed (separate privileged accounts)

Continuous:

1. Test control effectiveness: /grc-engineer:test-control AC-2
2. Review tailoring decisions annually
3. Update as cloud environment evolves
