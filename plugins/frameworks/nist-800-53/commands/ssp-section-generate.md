PART B: CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

AC-2: Account Management

Your Company manages information system accounts for the [System Name] through
automated provisioning integrated with our authoritative HR system (BambooHR)
and enterprise identity provider (Okta). This control ensures that access to
organizational information systems is appropriately authorized, monitored, and
reviewed.

AC-2(a) - Account Types

Your Company maintains the following account types to support organizational
missions and business functions:

  1. Workforce Accounts (Individual User Accounts)
     - Purpose: Daily operational access for employees and contractors
     - Authentication: Federated via Okta SSO to AWS IAM Identity Center
     - Lifecycle: Created upon hire, disabled upon termination
     - Count: Approximately 142 active users (as of December 2024)
     - Naming Convention: firstname.lastname@company.com

  2. Service Accounts (Application Accounts)
     - Purpose: Automated system-to-system communication
     - Implementation: AWS IAM roles (not user accounts)
     - Examples: Lambda execution roles, ECS task roles, EC2 instance profiles
     - Count: 23 active service roles
     - Naming Convention: service-[app-name]-[environment]

  3. Emergency Access Accounts (Break-Glass Accounts)
     - Purpose: Emergency access when SSO unavailable
     - Implementation: IAM users with MFA, normally disabled
     - Approval: CISO approval required for creation and use
     - Expiration: Automatically disabled after 72 hours
     - Count: 2 accounts (root alternative, emergency admin)

  4. Contractor Accounts (Temporary Accounts)
     - Purpose: Short-term access for consultants and vendors
     - Authentication: Federated via Okta (same as workforce)
     - Expiration: Maximum 6-month duration, extended only with approval
     - Count: Variable (5-10 active at any time)

AC-2(b) - Account Managers

Account managers are assigned based on organizational structure and account type:

  - Workforce Accounts: Managed by IT Operations team
    Contact: it-ops@company.com
    Responsibilities: Provisioning, access reviews, compliance monitoring

  - Service Accounts: Managed by application development teams
    Contact: Application owners (documented in Jira)
    Responsibilities: Role creation, permission assignment, quarterly review

  - Emergency Access Accounts: Managed by CISO
    Contact: ciso@company.com
    Responsibilities: Creation approval, usage monitoring, incident review

  - Contractor Accounts: Managed by hiring manager + IT Operations
    Contact: Manager who requested access
    Responsibilities: Approval, access review, termination notification

AC-2(c) - Group and Role Membership

Group and role membership is established using role-based access control (RBAC)
aligned with job functions. Groups are defined in Okta and synchronized to AWS
IAM Identity Center permission sets.

  Standard Roles:
    - Developer: Read/write access to dev environment, read-only to prod
    - QA Engineer: Read/write access to QA environment, read-only to dev/prod
    - DevOps Engineer: Full access to all environments (with approval)
    - Data Analyst: Read-only access to analytics databases
    - Support Engineer: Read-only access to production logs and metrics

  Privileged Roles (require additional approval):
    - Administrator: Full access to AWS management console
    - Security Analyst: Access to security tooling (GuardDuty, Security Hub)
    - Database Administrator: Write access to production databases

  Group membership conditions are documented in the Access Control Policy v1.8,
  section 4.2 "Role-Based Access Control Matrix."

AC-2(d) - Authorized Users and Privileges

Authorized users of the information system, their group/role membership, and
access authorizations are specified and documented in Okta as the authoritative
source of identity. Access privileges are mapped to AWS IAM Identity Center
permission sets.

  Process:
    1. User identity established in BambooHR (upon hire)
    2. Manager specifies required access via Jira Service Desk ticket
    3. IT Operations validates against RBAC matrix
    4. Access provisioned in Okta (synchronized to AWS within 15 minutes)
    5. User receives welcome email with MFA enrollment instructions

  Attributes maintained for each account:
    - Full name, email address, employee ID
    - Department, manager, job title
    - Group memberships (Okta groups)
    - Permission sets (AWS IAM Identity Center)
    - Account status (active, suspended, disabled)
    - MFA enrollment status
    - Last login date

AC-2(e) - Approval Requirements

Requests to create information system accounts require approval based on the
following matrix:

  Standard User Accounts:
    - Approval Required: Direct manager
    - Method: Jira Service Desk ticket with manager approval
    - SLA: 4 business hours

  Privileged User Accounts:
    - Approval Required: Direct manager + CISO
    - Method: Jira ticket + email to ciso@company.com
    - Justification: Business need documented in ticket
    - SLA: 24 business hours

  Service Accounts (IAM Roles):
    - Approval Required: Application owner + Security team
    - Method: Terraform pull request with approvers
    - Review: Security team reviews IAM permissions for least privilege
    - SLA: 48 business hours

  Emergency Access Accounts:
    - Approval Required: CISO only
    - Method: Email request with justification
    - Review: Incident post-mortem required after use
    - SLA: 1 business hour (emergency only)

AC-2(f) - Account Lifecycle Procedures

Information system accounts are created, enabled, modified, disabled, and
removed in accordance with the following automated procedures:

  Account Creation:
    1. HR creates employee record in BambooHR
    2. Manager submits access request via Jira Service Desk
    3. Automated workflow validates approval
    4. Okta account provisioned automatically (via BambooHR integration)
    5. AWS SSO account created (via Okta SCIM integration)
    6. User receives welcome email with MFA enrollment link
    7. Ticket closed automatically after successful provisioning
    Evidence: Jira ticket, Okta audit log, CloudTrail IAM events

  Account Modification:
    1. Manager submits modification request via Jira
    2. IT Operations reviews and approves
    3. Okta group membership updated manually or via API
    4. AWS permission sets updated automatically (SCIM sync)
    5. User notified of access change via email
    Evidence: Jira ticket, Okta audit log

  Account Disable (Termination):
    1. HR marks employee as terminated in BambooHR
    2. BambooHR webhook triggers automated workflow (n8n)
    3. Okta account disabled within 4 hours (Lambda function)
    4. AWS SSO access revoked automatically (SCIM sync)
    5. Notification sent to IT Operations and manager
    6. Access keys rotated for any services the user had access to
    Evidence: BambooHR termination date, Okta audit log, CloudTrail

  Account Removal:
    1. Disabled accounts reviewed after 90 days
    2. If no reactivation needed, account deleted from Okta
    3. AWS SSO account removed (SCIM sync)
    4. Final backup of user's data (if applicable)
    Evidence: Quarterly cleanup reports

AC-2(g) - Account Usage Monitoring

The use of information system accounts is monitored through multiple mechanisms:

  Real-Time Monitoring:
    - AWS CloudTrail: All IAM and AWS API activity logged
    - Amazon GuardDuty: Threat detection and anomaly analysis
    - Okta System Log: All authentication and authorization events

  Daily Monitoring:
    - IAM credential report generated daily (last login dates)
    - Inactive account detection (>90 days no login)
    - Failed login attempt analysis (brute force detection)

  Monthly Monitoring:
    - Privileged access usage review (administrator actions)
    - Excessive permission usage (unused IAM permissions)

  Automated Alerts:
    - Unusual login location or time (GuardDuty finding)
    - Privilege escalation attempts (CloudTrail alarm)
    - Multiple failed login attempts (Okta alert)
    - Dormant account reactivation (after 60+ days inactive)

AC-2(h) - Account Manager Notifications

Account managers are notified automatically in the following scenarios:

  When accounts are no longer required:
    - Quarterly access review report lists all accounts under their purview
    - Manager must attest that each account is still needed
    - Unattested accounts flagged for review

  When users are terminated or transferred:
    - Immediate Slack notification to manager and IT Operations
    - Email summary of access removed
    - Confirmation that all access was revoked within SLA

  When usage or need-to-know changes:
    - Role change detected in BambooHR triggers access review
    - Manager receives email to re-certify required access
    - Automated comparison of new role vs. current permissions

AC-2(i) - Access Authorization Criteria

Access to the information system is authorized based on:

  Valid Access Authorization:
    - Approved Jira Service Desk ticket
    - Manager approval documented
    - Security team approval (if privileged access)

  Intended System Usage:
    - Job function documented in BambooHR
    - Business need articulated in access request
    - Alignment with RBAC matrix

  Other Attributes:

    - All workforce accounts reviewed by managers
    - Service accounts reviewed by application owners
    - Attestation that access is still required and appropriate
    - Removal of unnecessary access
    - Documentation: Quarterly access review reports

  Monthly Reviews (every 30 days):

  Daily Automated Checks:
    - Inactive accounts (>90 days no login)
    - Emergency accounts (>72 hours enabled)
    - Accounts without MFA enrollment
    - Documentation: Daily automated reports

AC-2(k) - Shared Account Credential Reissuance

Your Company policy prohibits shared user accounts. Service accounts (AWS IAM
roles) are used where multiple systems need equivalent access, but these do not
use static credentials.

  For the limited cases where service account credentials exist:
    - Stored in AWS Secrets Manager
    - Automatic rotation enabled (30-day rotation)
    - Manual rotation triggered when team membership changes
    - Notification sent to all users with access after rotation
    - Audit trail maintained in Secrets Manager

  Process:
    1. Team membership change detected (user added or removed from group)
    2. EventBridge rule triggers Lambda function
    3. Secrets Manager automatic rotation initiated
    4. New credentials propagated to services
    5. Old credentials invalidated
    6. Notification sent to application owner
    Evidence: Secrets Manager rotation logs

Control Enhancement Implementations:

AC-2(1) - Automated System Account Management

Your Company employs the following automated mechanisms to support account
management:

  Provisioning Automation:
    - Okta provisioning API (SCIM 2.0 to AWS IAM Identity Center)
    - BambooHR to Okta integration (user lifecycle)
    - Terraform for IAM role creation and management

  Deprovisioning Automation:
    - Lambda function: deprovision-user (triggered by BambooHR webhook)
    - Executes within 4 hours of termination event
    - Disables Okta account, revokes AWS sessions, deactivates access keys

  Monitoring Automation:
    - Lambda function: check-inactive-accounts (daily execution)
    - EventBridge rule: detect emergency account age >72 hours
    - AWS Config rule: detect IAM users without MFA

  Evidence: Lambda function source code, CloudTrail execution logs

AC-2(2) - Removal of Temporary / Emergency Accounts

The information system automatically disables temporary and emergency accounts
after the following time periods:

  Emergency Access Accounts:
    - Time Period: 72 hours
    - Implementation: EventBridge rule triggers Lambda daily
    - Action: Disable IAM user, send notification to CISO
    - Override: CISO can extend for additional 72 hours (documented)

  Contractor Accounts:
    - Time Period: 6 months (180 days)
    - Implementation: Okta user object has expiration date attribute
    - Action: Okta lifecycle policy auto-disables on expiration
    - Extension: Manager can request extension via Jira (requires justification)

  Evidence: Lambda function logs, Okta lifecycle policy configuration

AC-2(3) - Disable Inactive Accounts

The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after 90 days
of inactivity.

  Implementation:
    - Daily Lambda function: check-inactive-accounts
    - Data source: IAM credential report (last login date)
    - Warning: Email to user and manager after 75 days inactive
    - Action: Disable account after 90 days
    - Notification: Email to manager confirming disable
    - Reactivation: User can request reactivation via Jira

  Exceptions:
    - Service accounts (IAM roles) excluded (no interactive login)
    - Emergency accounts already covered by AC-2(2)

  Evidence: IAM credential reports (daily), disable action logs

AC-2(4) - Automated Audit Actions

The information system automatically audits all account management actions and
notifies designated personnel:

  Audit Logging:
    - AWS CloudTrail logs all IAM API calls
    - Okta System Log records all account changes
    - Logs retained for 365 days online, 3 years total

  Notification Recipients:
    - Account creation: IT Operations (Slack notification)
    - Account deletion: CISO + IT Operations (email)
    - Privilege escalation: CISO + Security team (PagerDuty alert)
    - Failed login attempts (>5): User + manager (email)

  Automated Notifications:
    - EventBridge rule filters CloudTrail for IAM events
    - Lambda function formats notification
    - SNS topic publishes to Slack + email

  Evidence: CloudTrail logs, SNS delivery logs, Slack message archive

AC-2(9) - Restrictions on Use of Shared/Group Accounts

Your Company only permits the use of shared/group accounts under the following
conditions:

  Conditions for Shared Accounts:
    1. Service accounts only (not for human users)
    2. Implemented as AWS IAM roles (temporary credentials)
    3. Approved by Security team
    4. Documented in service account registry

    6. Automatic rotation enabled

  Prohibited:
    - Shared human user accounts (enforce unique accounts for all personnel)
    - Generic accounts (admin, root, etc.)
    - Group accounts without audit trail

  Enforcement:
    - Okta policy prohibits account sharing
    - AWS Config rule detects IAM users with shared access keys
    - Automated alert if policy violation detected

  Evidence: Access Control Policy (section 3.4), Config rule results

AC-2(12) - Account Monitoring / Atypical Usage (FedRAMP Addition)

Your Company monitors information system accounts for the following atypical
usage scenarios and reports to designated personnel:

  Atypical Usage Scenarios Monitored:
    - Login from unusual geographic location (outside US)
    - Login at unusual time (outside business hours)
    - Excessive API calls (rate limiting)
    - Privilege escalation attempts
    - Access to data outside normal scope
    - Use of emergency accounts (always atypical)

  Monitoring Mechanisms:
    - Amazon GuardDuty: Anomaly-based threat detection
    - Okta ThreatInsight: IP reputation and anomaly detection
    - CloudWatch Anomaly Detection: API call volume analysis
    - Custom Lambda: Detect after-hours privileged access

  Reporting:
