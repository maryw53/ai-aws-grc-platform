2. IA-5(1) - Update password policy ($0 cost, 2 hours)
3. SI-2(2) - Patch Manager ($100/month, 16 hours)
4. AU-4(1) - Cross-region log replication ($200/month, 16 hours)

High Impact:

1. IA-2(12) - PIV/CAC support ($5k, 40 hours) - REQUIRED for gov users
2. CA-7(3) - Trend analysis ($300/month, 32 hours)
3. RA-5(5) - Credentialed scanning ($500/month, 16 hours)

Generate Implementation Code:

```bash

# Generate IaC to fix
/grc-engineer:generate-implementation AC-2 aws
/grc-engineer:generate-implementation AU-4 aws
# ... for each gap

# Or use SOC2 gap-to-code

### Privacy Overlay

Adds privacy-specific controls:
- AP-1: Authority to Collect PII
- AP-2: Purpose Specification
- AR-*: Accountability, Audit, and Risk Management family
