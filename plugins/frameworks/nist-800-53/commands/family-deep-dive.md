NIST 800-53 CONTROL FAMILY DEEP DIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Family: Access Control (AC)
Baseline: Moderate
Environment: Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FAMILY OVERVIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Purpose:
  The Access Control family addresses the policies, procedures, and technical
  controls to limit information system access to authorized users, processes
  acting on behalf of authorized users, and devices (including other systems).

Core Principles:
  - Least Privilege: Users have minimum access needed
  - Separation of Duties: Critical functions split among multiple users
  - Need-to-Know: Access based on job function requirements
  - Defense in Depth: Multiple layers of access control

Control Count in Moderate Baseline: 25 controls
  - Base controls: 22
  - Enhancements: 3 additional
  - Optional enhancements: 40+ available

Maturity Model:
  Level 1 (Basic): Authentication, authorization, auditing
  Level 2 (Intermediate): RBAC, periodic reviews, automated provisioning
  Level 3 (Advanced): Attribute-based access, real-time analytics, zero trust

Common Failures:
  - Orphaned accounts (users who left but access remains)
  - Excessive privileges (admin access for non-admin tasks)
  - Stale access (permissions granted but no longer needed)
  - Shared accounts (cannot attribute actions to individuals)
  - No access reviews (permissions drift over time)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
KEY CONTROLS (Moderate Baseline)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

AC-1: Policy and Procedures
  Purpose: Establish governance for access control
  Implementation: Document access control policy, procedures, review annually
  Cloud Pattern: Store in version control (Git), require exec approval
  Effort: 16 hours (initial), 4 hours/year (review)
  Evidence: Policy document, approval memo, annual review log

AC-2: Account Management ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
  Purpose: Manage system account lifecycle (create, modify, disable, delete)
  Implementation: Automated provisioning via identity provider
  Cloud Pattern: Okta/Azure AD → AWS SSO, automated deprovisioning
  Effort: 40 hours (automation setup), 10 hours/month (reviews)
  Evidence: IAM user lists, quarterly access reviews, termination logs
  Common Gap: Manual deprovisioning leads to orphaned accounts
  Fix: Integrate HR system with IAM for automated lifecycle

AC-3: Access Enforcement
  Purpose: Enforce approved authorizations for system access
  Implementation: RBAC or ABAC policies, deny-by-default
  Cloud Pattern: IAM policies, Security Groups, RBAC
  Effort: 24 hours (initial policy design)
  Evidence: IAM policy documents, access logs showing enforcement
  Common Gap: Overly permissive policies (e.g., AdministratorAccess for all)
  Fix: Implement least privilege via managed policies per role

AC-4: Information Flow Enforcement
  Purpose: Control information flow between systems and networks
  Implementation: Network segmentation, data loss prevention
  Cloud Pattern: VPCs, subnets, NACLs, Security Groups, VPC endpoints
  Effort: 32 hours (network design)
  Evidence: Network diagram, security group rules, flow logs
  Common Gap: Flat network (all systems can communicate)
  Fix: Segment by environment (dev/stage/prod) and tier (web/app/data)

AC-5: Separation of Duties
  Purpose: Divide critical functions among different individuals
  Implementation: Dual approval for sensitive actions, role segregation
  Cloud Pattern: IAM policies prevent single user from both create + approve
  Effort: 16 hours (policy design)
  Evidence: IAM policies showing separation, audit logs
  Example: Developers can create resources, but can't deploy to production

AC-6: Least Privilege ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
  Purpose: Grant only minimum necessary permissions
  Implementation: Role-based policies, periodic permission reviews
  Cloud Pattern: Managed policies (AWS), Azure RBAC, GCP IAM
  Effort: 40 hours (initial), ongoing refinement
  Evidence: Permission analysis, unused permission reports
  Common Gap: Over-permissioning (easier to give broad access)
  Fix: Start with read-only, add permissions as needed with justification

AC-7: Unsuccessful Login Attempts
  Purpose: Lock accounts after failed login attempts
  Implementation: Failed login threshold (e.g., 5 attempts), lockout duration
  Cloud Pattern: Okta/Azure AD account lockout policy
  Effort: 2 hours (configuration)
  Evidence: Account lockout policy screenshot, lockout event logs
  Best Practice: 5 attempts, 30-minute lockout

AC-8: System Use Notification
  Purpose: Display warning banner before login
  Implementation: Login page banner, SSH banner
  Cloud Pattern: CloudFront → S3 static page with banner, SSH config
  Effort: 4 hours
  Evidence: Screenshot of banner, SSH config file
  Required Text: "Authorized use only. Activity monitored and logged."

AC-11: Session Lock
  Purpose: Lock session after period of inactivity
  Implementation: Auto-logout after inactivity
  Cloud Pattern: Okta/AWS SSO session timeout (15 minutes)
  Effort: 2 hours
  Evidence: Session policy configuration
  Best Practice: 15 minutes for general, 5 minutes for privileged

AC-14: Permitted Actions Without Identification
  Purpose: Identify actions allowed before authentication
  Implementation: Document unauthenticated endpoints (health checks, etc.)
  Cloud Pattern: ALB health check endpoint (no auth required)
  Effort: 4 hours (documentation)
  Evidence: List of public endpoints with justification

AC-17: Remote Access
  Purpose: Control remote access to systems
  Implementation: VPN, bastion hosts, MFA for remote access
  Cloud Pattern: AWS Session Manager, Azure Bastion, GCP IAP
  Effort: 24 hours
  Evidence: VPN config, bastion host logs, MFA enrollment
  Best Practice: No direct SSH, use Session Manager with MFA

AC-18: Wireless Access
  Purpose: Control wireless network access
  Implementation: WPA3 encryption, 802.1X authentication
  Cloud Pattern: N/A for cloud-only (office network if hybrid)
  Effort: 16 hours (if applicable)
  Evidence: Wireless config, authentication logs

AC-19: Access Control for Mobile Devices
  Purpose: Control mobile device access to systems
  Implementation: MDM, device enrollment, remote wipe
  Cloud Pattern: Okta Verify (mobile MFA), conditional access
  Effort: 20 hours
  Evidence: MDM enrollment list, mobile access logs
  Best Practice: Require MDM enrollment for corporate data access

AC-20: Use of External Information Systems
  Purpose: Control access via external systems
  Implementation: Approved vendor list, security requirements
  Cloud Pattern: VPN to partner networks, API authentication
  Effort: 12 hours (per external system)
  Evidence: Vendor agreements, security assessments
  Example: Allow Salesforce to access customer data via API (approved)

AC-22: Publicly Accessible Content
  Purpose: Control publicly posted information
  Implementation: Content approval process, review before publish
  Cloud Pattern: S3 bucket policies (deny public by default)
  Effort: 8 hours
  Evidence: S3 bucket policies, content approval workflow
  Common Gap: Accidentally public S3 buckets
  Fix: Enable S3 Block Public Access at account level

  3. Use Session Manager to connect
  4. Verify MFA required for Session Manager
  Expected Result: Session Manager works, direct SSH blocked

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COMMON PITFALLS AND SOLUTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Pitfall 1: Orphaned Accounts
  Problem: Users leave, accounts remain active
  Impact: Security risk, compliance violation
  Solution: Integrate HR system with IAM, automated deprovisioning
  Detection: Daily credential report, inactive account check
  Fix: /grc-engineer:generate-implementation AC-2 aws

Pitfall 2: Excessive Permissions
  Problem: Users have admin access when not needed
  Impact: Increased blast radius of compromise
  Solution: Implement least privilege, regular permission reviews
  Detection: AWS Access Analyzer, unused permission report
  Fix: Remove broad policies, create role-specific policies

Pitfall 3: No Access Reviews
  Problem: Permissions drift over time, never reviewed
  Impact: Users accumulate unnecessary access
  Solution: Automated quarterly access reviews
  Detection: Compare current access vs. required access
  Fix: EventBridge + Lambda to generate review reports

Pitfall 4: Shared Accounts
  Problem: Multiple users share one account
  Impact: Cannot attribute actions, accountability lost
  Solution: Unique accounts for all users, use roles for services
  Detection: Check for shared access keys (Access Analyzer)
  Fix: Disable shared accounts, create individual accounts

Pitfall 5: Weak Remote Access
  Problem: Direct SSH with password authentication
  Impact: Brute force attacks, credential theft
  Solution: Session Manager (no SSH keys), MFA required
  Detection: Review security group rules for port 22/3389
  Fix: Disable public access, enable Session Manager
