# SOC 2 TSC Matrix Generator

Generates a comprehensive implementation matrix showing which Trust Service Criteria (TSC) controls are implemented, partially implemented, or not applicable, with mapping to infrastructure components.

## Usage

```bash
/soc2:generate-tsc-matrix [criteria] [output-format]
```

## Arguments

- `$1` - Criteria (optional): "security", "availability", "confidentiality", "processing-integrity", "privacy", or "all" (default: "security")
- `$2` - Output format (optional): "table", "json", "csv", "markdown" (default: "table")

## Examples

```bash
# Generate matrix for Security criteria only
/soc2:generate-tsc-matrix security

# All Trust Service Criteria
/soc2:generate-tsc-matrix all table

# Export as CSV for spreadsheet
/soc2:generate-tsc-matrix all csv > tsc-matrix.csv

# JSON output for automation
/soc2:generate-tsc-matrix security json
```

During Audit Period:
1. Maintain quarterly access reviews (CC6.1)
2. Conduct quarterly management reviews (CC4.2)
3. Continue automated control testing
4. Document any control changes or exceptions

Pre-Audit Preparation:
1. Run final evidence completeness check
2. Organize evidence by TSC control

4. Schedule pre-audit meeting with service auditor

Continuous Improvement:
1. Increase automated testing coverage (target: 75%)
2. Implement CC7.2 quality monitoring
3. Add external availability monitoring (CC7.4)
4. Hire dedicated GRC analyst (CC1.3)
