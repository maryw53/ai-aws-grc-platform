# SOC 2 Evidence Checklist

Generates detailed evidence collection checklists for SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria with automated and manual collection guidance.

> **Never commit evidence artifacts to source control.** The outputs below include real usernames, credential reports, MFA device states, and privileged-account inventories. `.gitignore` covers `evidence/` by default so `git add -A` will not sweep it up, but durable storage is your responsibility. Use an encrypted, access-controlled evidence locker (encrypted S3 with least-privilege IAM, a GRC platform, or a shared drive with full-disk encryption and MFA-gated access).

## Usage

```bash
/soc2:evidence-checklist <control-id> [audit-type]
```

## Arguments

- `$1` - Control ID (e.g., "CC6.1", "CC7.2", "A1.1") or category (e.g., "CC6", "security")
- `$2` - Audit type (optional): "type1" (point-in-time) or "type2" (period) - default: "type2"

## Examples

```bash
# Single control evidence requirements
/soc2:evidence-checklist CC6.1

# All access control evidence (CC6 family)
/soc2:evidence-checklist CC6

# Type I audit (point-in-time)
/soc2:evidence-checklist CC7.2 type1

# Full security category
/soc2:evidence-checklist security type2
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS (Type II)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Population: All access requests during audit period
Sampling Method: Random or systematic
Sample Size:

- If population < 25: 100% testing (all items)
- If population 25-100: Minimum 25 samples
- If population > 100: Minimum 25 samples + judgment sampling

Quarterly Coverage: Each quarter must have samples
  Q1: Minimum 6 samples (25% of year)
  Q2: Minimum 6 samples
  Q3: Minimum 6 samples
  Q4: Minimum 7 samples
  Total: 25 samples minimum

Example for 200 total requests:

- 25 random samples (12.5%)
- Distributed across 12 months
- Additional 5 judgmental samples (high-risk access)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ADEQUACY CRITERIA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Policy Requirements:
✓ Policy document exists and is current (<12 months)
✓ Policy approved by executive management
✓ Policy communicated to relevant personnel
✓ Policy addresses all key control points

Process Requirements:
✓ Access provisioning follows documented procedure
✓ Access requires approval before granting
✓ Access reviews performed at stated frequency (quarterly)
✓ Terminations processed same-day or next business day

Technical Requirements:
✓ All users have unique identifiers (no shared accounts)
✓ Privileged access separated from normal access
✓ MFA enabled for remote/privileged access (if in policy)
✓ All access changes logged in CloudTrail/audit log
✓ Audit logs retained for minimum 1 year

Exception Handling:
⚠ Zero unresolved Access Analyzer findings
⚠ All access review exceptions documented and approved
⚠ No unauthorized access detected in testing
⚠ All termination access removed within 24 hours

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COMMON DEFICIENCIES TO AVOID
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ Access review not performed for all 4 quarters
   Impact: Control deficiency, qualification in report
   Fix: Ensure reviews scheduled quarterly, not "as needed"

❌ No approval documentation for access requests
   Impact: Cannot demonstrate proper authorization
   Fix: Require tickets for all access (even verbal requests)

❌ Terminations not processed timely (>24 hours)
   Impact: Security risk, control deficiency
   Fix: Automated deprovisioning on HR system update

❌ Shared administrator accounts
   Impact: Cannot attribute actions to individuals
   Fix: Unique admin accounts per person

❌ Access reviews incomplete (missing users)
   Impact: Control not operating effectively
   Fix: Automated user export, checklist validation

❌ Policy not updated annually
   Impact: Documentation deficiency
   Fix: Annual review process with calendar reminder

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TYPE I vs TYPE II DIFFERENCES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Type I (Point-in-Time):

- Single snapshot on specific date
- Policy must be in effect on exam date
- Sample size: 1-5 samples for design effectiveness
- Access review: Only need current review
- Duration: Typically 1-2 weeks

Type II (Period Testing):

- Minimum 6 months, typically 12 months
- Policy must be in effect entire period
- Sample size: 25+ samples across entire period
- Access reviews: 2 minimum (6 months) or 4 (12 months)
- Duration: Typically 2-4 weeks of audit work

Recommendation: Type II provides more value and market trust

AUTOMATED EVIDENCE COLLECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Generate complete evidence package:

```bash
/soc2:service-auditor-prep CC6.1 --period 2024 --output ./evidence
```

This will:
✓ Collect all automated evidence (IAM, CloudTrail, etc.)
✓ Generate evidence checklist with gaps identified
✓ Create folder structure for manual evidence
✓ Produce evidence matrix spreadsheet
✓ Generate draft PBC (Provided By Client) list

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Review checklist and identify gaps
2. Collect automated evidence using provided scripts
3. Gather manual evidence (tickets, reviews, etc.)
4. Organize evidence in recommended structure
5. Run /soc2:service-auditor-prep to package for auditor
6. Review with audit team before providing to auditor
