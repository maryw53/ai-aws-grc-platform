COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ Skipping a quarterly review
   Impact: Gap in testing, potential deficiency
   Prevention: Calendar reminders, automated triggers

❌ Policy dated after period start
   Impact: Control not in effect, design deficiency
   Prevention: Finalize all policies 1+ months before

❌ Missing evidence from early months
   Impact: Cannot prove control operated entire period
   Prevention: Start collecting evidence from Day 1

❌ Control automation fails mid-period
   Impact: Gap in control operation
   Prevention: Monitoring alerts, daily checks

❌ Insufficient samples
   Impact: Auditor cannot conclude on effectiveness
   Prevention: Maintain ticketing system, save all

❌ Undocumented changes
   Impact: Cannot demonstrate change control
   Prevention: Require tickets for all changes
