2. **MFA everywhere** (8.4.2, 8.5.1) - CDE access requires MFA
3. **Automated log review** (10.4.1.1) - Manual review no longer sufficient
4. **Authenticated scanning** (11.3.1.1) - Better vulnerability detection

## Example

```bash
/pci-dss:march-2025
/pci-dss:march-2025 8
/pci-dss:march-2025 "payment page"
```
