# DORA Evidence Checklist

Generates comprehensive evidence collection checklists for EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) requirements, tailored for financial entities operating in the EU with ICT risk management focus.

> **Never commit evidence artifacts to source control.** The outputs below include real usernames, credential reports, MFA device states, and privileged-account inventories. `.gitignore` covers `evidence/` by default so `git add -A` will not sweep it up, but durable storage is your responsibility. Use an encrypted, access-controlled evidence locker (encrypted S3 with least-privilege IAM, a GRC platform, or a shared drive with full-disk encryption and MFA-gated access).

## Usage

```bash
/dora:evidence-checklist <article> [--entity-type <credit|investment|payment>] [--export <format>]
```

## Arguments

- `<article>`: DORA article (e.g., "Article 6", "Article 9", "Article 11") or topic (e.g., "ICT Risk Management", "Incident Reporting", "Testing")
- `--entity-type`: Financial entity type (`credit`, `investment`, `payment`, `crypto`, `insurance`). Default: `credit`
- `--export`: Export format (`json`, `csv`, `markdown`). Default: `markdown`

## Example: ICT Risk Management Framework Evidence

```bash
/dora:evidence-checklist "Article 6" --entity-type credit
```

**Output:**

```markdown

## DORA Supervisory Expectations

National competent authorities (NCAs) will expect:

### Documentation Requirements

✓ ICT Risk Framework formally approved by management body
✓ Framework reviewed and updated annually (at minimum)
✓ Quarterly risk reporting to senior management
✓ Annual comprehensive report to Board
✓ Policies aligned with EBA/ESMA/EIOPA guidelines

### Implementation Requirements

✓ All ICT assets inventoried and classified by criticality
✓ Risk assessments cover all ICT systems (including third-party)
✓ Risk treatment plans for all material ICT risks
✓ Continuous monitoring and detection capabilities
✓ Incident response procedures tested
✓ BC/DR plans tested annually

### Testing and Validation

✓ Annual DR test (full scenario)
✓ Threat-led penetration testing (TLPT) for significant entities
✓ Vulnerability scanning (at least quarterly)
✓ Patch management procedures enforced
✓ Third-party ICT provider audits/assessments

### Reporting to Supervisors

✓ Major ICT incidents reported within 4 hours (initial), 24 hours (intermediate), <1 month (final)
✓ Annual DORA compliance attestation (expected from NCAs)
✓ On-demand reporting for supervisory reviews

## Common DORA Assessment Findings

### Critical (Non-Compliance)

❌ No documented ICT Risk Framework
❌ Framework not approved by management body
❌ No ICT asset inventory or incomplete inventory
❌ No business impact analysis for critical services
❌ No annual DR testing
❌ Major incidents not reported to NCA within timeframes

### Moderate (Gaps requiring remediation)

⚠️ ICT Risk Framework not reviewed annually
⚠️ Quarterly risk reporting to Board incomplete
⚠️ Some ICT assets not classified by criticality
⚠️ Third-party ICT risk assessments incomplete
⚠️ Vulnerability management process gaps
⚠️ Patch SLAs not defined or enforced

### Minor (Best practice recommendations)

⚠️ Risk register not updated quarterly
⚠️ Monitoring dashboards incomplete
⚠️ DR test scenarios limited (need more comprehensive tests)
⚠️ Evidence retention <5 years

## Remediation Guidance

### If No ICT Risk Framework Exists

1. **Immediate (Weeks 1-4)**: Draft ICT Risk Framework
   - Use EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk (EBA/GL/2019/04) as template
   - Adapt to organization size and complexity
   - Include all 7 required components (governance, ID, protect, detect, respond, recover, testing)

2. **Weeks 5-8**: Board Approval Process
   - Present framework to ICT Risk Committee
   - Revise based on feedback
   - Present to Board for approval
   - Document approval in Board minutes

3. **Weeks 9-12**: Implementation Planning
   - Develop detailed policies and procedures
   - Assign roles and responsibilities
   - Implement risk assessment process
   - Launch asset inventory project

**Timeline**: 3-4 months minimum before DORA deadline

### If Asset Inventory Incomplete

1. **Use automated discovery** (AWS Config, Azure Resource Graph, etc.)
2. **Classify assets by criticality** (align with BIA)
3. **Document asset owners** (business + technical owners)
4. **Implement continuous asset tracking** (not one-time snapshot)

**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks depending on estate size

### If DR Testing Not Performed

1. **Schedule annual DR test** (before DORA deadline)
2. **Define test scenarios** (loss of primary data center, ransomware, etc.)
3. **Involve all critical stakeholders**
4. **Document results and lessons learned**
5. **Remediate gaps within 90 days**

**Timeline**: 2-3 months (planning + execution + remediation)
