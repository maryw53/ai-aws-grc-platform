# DORA Incident Reporting

Provides comprehensive guidance on DORA's incident management and reporting requirements for major ICT-related incidents.

## Arguments

- `$1` - Incident severity (required: major, non-major, cyber-threat)
- `$2` - Reporting stage (optional: initial, intermediate, final, update)

## Incident Reporting Overview

**Legal Basis**: Articles 17-23 of DORA
**Requirement**: Mandatory reporting of major incidents to national competent authorities
**Timeline**: Strict deadlines (4 hours, 72 hours, 1 month)
**Penalties**: Significant fines for non-compliance

## Incident Classification

### Major Incident Criteria (Article 18)

An ICT-related incident is classified as **major** if it meets one or more of these criteria:

#### 1. Impact on Financial Services

**Threshold Indicators**:

- Multiple business days affected

**Typical Thresholds** (entity-specific):

- Critical services: >2-4 hours
- Important services: >4-8 hours
- Supporting services: >24 hours

#### 4. Geographical Spread

**Threshold Indicators**:

- Incident affects operations in multiple EU member states
- Cross-border service disruption
- International clients impacted
- Widespread system failure

#### 5. Data Loss or Corruption

**Threshold Indicators**:

- Client compensation required

**Typical Thresholds**:

- Large institutions: >EUR 100,000
- Medium institutions: >EUR 50,000
- Small institutions: >EUR 10,000
- *(Proportionate to entity size and complexity)*

### Non-Major Incidents

**Characteristics**:

- Limited impact on services
- Contained to single function/system
- Quick resolution (within tolerance)
- Minimal client impact
- No data loss or corruption
- No reputational damage

**Reporting**:

- Internal tracking and documentation required
- No mandatory reporting to authorities
- May aggregate for trend analysis
- Report if incident escalates to major

### Cyber Threats (Article 20)

**Definition**:

- Potential cyber attack identified
- Vulnerability discovered that could be exploited
- Threat intelligence indicating targeting
- Reconnaissance or probing detected

**Reporting**:

- **Voluntary** notification to authorities
- Can share with other financial entities
- Liability protection for good faith sharing
- Helps collective defense

## Reporting Channels and Contacts

### National Competent Authority (NCA)

**Identify Your NCA**:

- Credit institutions: National banking supervisor (e.g., ECB, national central bank)
- Investment firms: National securities regulator
- Payment institutions: Payment services authority
- Insurance: National insurance regulator

**Single Point of Contact**:

- Designate internal contact person for NCA
- Provide contact details to NCA in advance
- Ensure 24/7 availability for major incidents
- Maintain backup contacts

**Submission Methods**:

- Electronic portal (varies by country)
- Secure email (encryption required)
- Dedicated incident reporting system
- Phone notification followed by written report

### Internal Escalation

**Notification Chain**:

1. IT/Security Operations Center (SOC)
2. Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
3. Chief Information Officer (CIO)
4. Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
5. Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
6. Board of Directors (for major incidents)

**Timing**:

- Immediate: SOC, CISO, CIO
- Within 1 hour: CRO, CEO (if major)
- Within 4 hours: Board chair (if major and ongoing)
- Next scheduled meeting: Full board briefing

## Incident Response Documentation

### Incident Log (All Incidents)

**Required Fields**:

- Incident ID
- Date and time of detection
- Date and time of classification
- Incident type (e.g., cyber attack, system failure, data breach)
- Affected systems and services
- Impact assessment
- Classification (major/non-major)
- Actions taken
- Status (open, contained, resolved, closed)
- Lessons learned

### Major Incident File

**Additional Documentation**:

- Initial notification submission and NCA confirmation
- Intermediate report submission
- Final report submission
- All updates and significant changes
- Evidence collected (logs, forensics, screenshots)
- Root cause analysis
- Post-incident review notes
- Remediation tracking
- Cost tracking

### Incident Response Plan

**Required Components**:

- Incident response team roles and responsibilities
- Classification criteria and decision trees
- Escalation procedures
- Communication templates
- NCA contact information
- Technical response procedures
- Recovery procedures
- Testing and training schedule

## Common Reporting Challenges

### Challenge 1: Classification Uncertainty

**Issue**: Unclear if incident meets major criteria
**Solution**:

- Use documented decision tree
- Consult with risk/compliance
- When in doubt, report as major (can downgrade later)
- Document classification rationale

### Challenge 2: Timeline Pressure

**Issue**: 4-hour notification deadline is tight
**Solution**:

- Pre-populate templates
- Automate data collection
- Designate on-call responders
- Conduct incident drills

### Challenge 3: Incomplete Information

**Issue**: Not all details available within deadlines
**Solution**:

- Provide best available information
- Clearly state what is preliminary/estimated
- Commit to updates as information emerges
- Document information gaps

### Challenge 4: Cross-Border Incidents

**Issue**: Incident affects multiple EU countries, unclear which NCA to notify
**Solution**:

- Notify NCA of home member state
- Indicate cross-border nature
- NCA will coordinate with other regulators
- May need to notify multiple NCAs (follow their guidance)

### Challenge 5: Third-Party Incidents

**Issue**: Incident originates from ICT service provider
**Solution**:

- Financial entity still responsible for reporting
- Coordinate with service provider for details
- Ensure service provider contractual obligation to provide incident information
- Report even if incident is provider's fault

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

**Failure to Report**:

- Administrative fines up to 1% of annual turnover
- Reputational damage
- Increased regulatory scrutiny
- Potential license implications

**Late Reporting**:

- Proportionate penalties based on delay
- Supervisory action
- Remediation requirements

**Inaccurate Reporting**:

- Penalties for misleading information
- Requirement to resubmit
- Loss of regulatory trust
