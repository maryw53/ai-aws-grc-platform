# /grc-engineer:pipeline-status

Reports on every connector registered in `~/.config/claude-grc/connectors/`. One block per connector with: status, auth validity, last-run timestamp, cached resource/evaluation counts, and any stale/expired signals.

## How to run

```bash
bash plugins/grc-engineer/scripts/pipeline-status.sh
```

## Output

```

## Status semantics

- `ready` — configured, auth valid, runs available
- `credentials-expired` — configured but the tool rejected auth at check time
- `not-configured` — config file doesn't exist
- `stale` — last run > 7 days ago
- `no-cache` — configured but never run

## Exit codes

- `0` — every connector is `ready` (possibly `stale`)
- `2` — at least one connector is `credentials-expired` or `not-configured`
