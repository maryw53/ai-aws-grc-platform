CROSS-FRAMEWORK CONFLICT ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Frameworks Analyzed: SOC2, PCI-DSS, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001
Controls Analyzed: 87 overlapping controls

CONFLICT SUMMARY:
  🔴 High Severity: 3 conflicts (require immediate attention)
  🟡 Medium Severity: 7 conflicts (may need adjustment)
  🟢 Low Severity: 12 conflicts (minor differences)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HIGH SEVERITY CONFLICTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔴 CONFLICT #1: Access Review Frequency
   Control Area: Account Management
   Affected Controls: NIST AC-2, ISO A.9.2.5, SOC2 CC6.1, PCI 8.1.4

   Requirements:
   - SOC2:    No specific frequency, risk-based approach
              (typically quarterly for sensitive systems)
   - PCI-DSS: Quarterly reviews MANDATORY (every 90 days)
              Requirement 8.1.4: At least quarterly
   - NIST:    Annually minimum, or when roles/responsibilities change
              AC-2 control statement
   - ISO:     At planned intervals (typically annually)
              A.9.2.5 requirement

   ⚠ IMPACT: PCI-DSS is most restrictive and MANDATORY
   ✓ RESOLUTION: Implement quarterly (90-day) access reviews

   Implementation:
   - Set automated reviews every 90 days
   - This satisfies PCI-DSS mandatory requirement
   - Exceeds NIST, ISO, SOC2 requirements
   - Document as quarterly in all framework documentation

   Code Example:
   ```python
   # AWS Lambda triggered every 90 days
   review_schedule = "rate(90 days)"
   ```

🔴 CONFLICT #2: Log Retention Period
   Control Area: Logging and Monitoring
   Affected Controls: NIST AU-11, ISO A.12.4.1, SOC2 CC7.3, PCI 10.7

   Requirements:

- SOC2:    Retention based on risk assessment
              (typically 1 year minimum)
- PCI-DSS: One year minimum, with at least 3 months
              immediately available for analysis
              Requirement 10.7 MANDATORY
- NIST:    Organization-defined period
              (typically 90 days online, 1 year archived)
- ISO:     As required by applicable regulations
              and contractual requirements

   ⚠ IMPACT: PCI-DSS specific requirements for availability
   ✓ RESOLUTION: 1 year total, 3+ months online/searchable

   Implementation:

- Online logs: 6 months (exceeds PCI 3-month minimum)
- Archived logs: 6 months (total = 1 year)
- Use cheaper storage for archived logs
- Satisfies all framework requirements

   Cloud Implementation:
   AWS:

- CloudWatch Logs: 6 months retention
- S3 Glacier: 6 months archived (total 1 year)

   Azure:

- Log Analytics: 6 months
- Archive Storage: 6 months

   GCP:

- Cloud Logging: 6 months
- Cloud Storage Archive: 6 months

🔴 CONFLICT #3: Inactive Account Handling
   Control Area: Account Management
   Affected Controls: NIST AC-2(3), SOC2 CC6.1, PCI 8.1.4

   Requirements:

- SOC2:    Remove or disable inactive accounts based on
              risk assessment (no specific timeline)
- PCI-DSS: Remove/disable inactive user accounts at least
              every 90 days - Requirement 8.1.4 MANDATORY
- NIST:    AC-2(3) - Organization-defined time period
              (commonly 90 days for government)
- ISO:     Review access rights at regular intervals

   ⚠ IMPACT: PCI-DSS mandatory 90-day requirement
   ✓ RESOLUTION: Automatically disable accounts after 90 days

   Implementation:

- Automated detection of accounts inactive 90+ days
- Automatic disablement (not deletion)
- Exception process for service accounts
- Monthly review of disabled accounts

   Automation:

   ```python
   # Disable users inactive for 90+ days
   inactive_threshold_days = 90

   def disable_inactive_users():
       users = iam.list_users()
       for user in users:
           last_used = get_last_activity(user)
           if days_since(last_used) >= 90:
               iam.disable_user(user)
               notify_security_team(user)
   ```

   Control Area: Authentication

   Requirements:

- PCI-DSS: Minimum 12 characters (as of March 2025)
              Complexity requirements

              No complexity requirements (deprecated)
- SOC2:    Strong password policy (not specified)
- ISO:     Adequate password policy

   ✓ RESOLUTION: 12+ characters with complexity

- Satisfies PCI-DSS March 2025 requirement
- Exceeds NIST minimum
- Implement passphrase support
- Consider MFA to reduce password burden

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LOW SEVERITY CONFLICTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🟢 CONFLICT #7: Encryption Algorithm Selection
   All frameworks accept AES-256 with FIPS 140-2
   ✓ RESOLUTION: Use AES-256 with FIPS 140-2 validated modules

🟢 CONFLICT #8: Security Awareness Training
   Frequency varies (annual to ongoing)
   ✓ RESOLUTION: Annual formal training + ongoing phishing tests

🟢 CONFLICT #9: Backup Frequency
   Daily to weekly depending on framework
   ✓ RESOLUTION: Daily automated backups

... (9 more low-severity conflicts)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RESOLUTION STRATEGY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

General Principle: "Most Restrictive Wins"

When conflicts exist:

1. Identify the most restrictive requirement
2. Implement to satisfy the highest standard
3. Document that implementation exceeds other frameworks
4. Verify all frameworks accept the implementation

Example:
  PCI-DSS requires quarterly access reviews
  → Implement quarterly reviews
  → Satisfies SOC2 (risk-based, quarterly is appropriate)
  → Exceeds NIST (annual minimum)
  → Exceeds ISO (annual typical)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HIGH PRIORITY (Must Address):
□ Set access reviews to 90-day frequency
□ Configure log retention: 6mo online + 6mo archive
□ Enable 90-day inactive account detection
□ Implement 12-character password minimum

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Recommended):
□ Schedule monthly vulnerability scans
□ Set firewall review calendar (every 6 months)
□ Update password policy documentation

LOW PRIORITY (Best Practices):
□ Use AES-256 with FIPS 140-2
□ Schedule annual security awareness training
□ Configure daily backups

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DOCUMENTATION GUIDANCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

When documenting your approach:

1. Create a Control Implementation Matrix showing:
   - Selected configuration (e.g., "90-day access reviews")
   - How it satisfies each framework requirement
   - Rationale for selection (most restrictive wins)

2. For auditors, note where you EXCEED requirements:
   - "Quarterly reviews exceed NIST annual requirement"
   - "6-month online logs exceed PCI 3-month requirement"

3. Maintain single source of truth:
   - Don't create different configs per framework
   - Document once, reference in all frameworks
   - Reduces drift and maintenance burden

2. Use /grc-engineer:optimize-multi-framework to see effort reduction
3. Use /grc-engineer:generate-implementation to create configurations
4. Use /grc-engineer:scan-iac to validate current state
5. Update documentation to reference conflict resolutions
