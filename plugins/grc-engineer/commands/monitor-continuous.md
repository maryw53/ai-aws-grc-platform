# Monitor Continuous

Runs a single pass of recurring compliance monitoring: orchestrates
`/grc-engineer:gap-assessment`, applies warn/critical thresholds per framework,
optionally chains `/grc-engineer:record-automation-metrics`, and emits a
structured JSON summary suitable for cron, GitHub Actions, Slack, email, or
PagerDuty.

Implementation: [`scripts/monitor-continuous.js`](../scripts/monitor-continuous.js).

## Usage

```bash
/grc-engineer:monitor-continuous <frameworks> [options]
/grc-engineer:monitor-continuous --config=<path>
```

The host scheduler (cron, EventBridge, GitHub Actions) provides recurrence; this
command executes one monitoring pass per invocation. The `schedule` value is
recorded in the output summary so downstream dashboards can group runs by
cadence.

## Arguments

- `<frameworks>` - Comma-separated frameworks (e.g. `SOC2,PCI-DSS,NIST-800-53`).
  Required unless supplied via `--config`.

## Options

- `--config=<path>` - YAML or JSON config (see below). CLI flags override config values.
- `--sources=<csv>` - Connectors whose cached findings should feed the assessment.
- `--schedule=<name>` - Label only (`daily`, `weekly`, `hourly`). Recorded in output.
- `--report-dir=<path>` - Where gap-assessment writes its bundle (default: `./monitor-continuous-<run_id>/`).
- `--output=<path>` - Write the JSON summary to this path. stdout always gets it too.
- `--warn-threshold=<0..1>` - Per-framework pass-rate warning floor (default: `0.90`).
- `--critical-threshold=<0..1>` - Per-framework pass-rate critical floor (default: `0.80`).
- `--record-metrics` - After assessment, run `record-automation-metrics.js`.
- `--metrics-config=<path>` - Config for record-automation-metrics (implies `--record-metrics`).
- `--window-label=<label>` - Forwarded to record-automation-metrics.
- `--cache-dir=<path>` - Forwarded to gap-assessment (finding cache dir).
- `--offline` - Use the local SCF cache only (no network).
- `--no-exit-code` - Always exit 0 even on threshold breach.
- `--quiet` - Suppress stderr progress.
- `--dry-run` - Resolve config + print planned actions; no subprocess runs.

## Examples

```bash
# Single pass over three frameworks using cached findings
node plugins/grc-engineer/scripts/monitor-continuous.js SOC2,PCI-DSS,NIST-800-53

# Daily monitoring driven by a config file
node plugins/grc-engineer/scripts/monitor-continuous.js \
  --config=plugins/grc-engineer/examples/monitor-continuous.yaml

# Chain automation-metrics snapshot on the same run
node plugins/grc-engineer/scripts/monitor-continuous.js SOC2 \
  --metrics-config=./automation-metrics.yaml --window-label=current-week

# Dry-run to validate config without spawning subprocesses
node plugins/grc-engineer/scripts/monitor-continuous.js \
  --config=./monitor-continuous.yaml --dry-run
```

## Exit codes

- `0` - All frameworks at or above the warning threshold.
- `2` - At least one framework below the warning threshold.
- `3` - At least one framework below the critical threshold.
- `1` - Usage error or subprocess failure.

Set `--no-exit-code` to always exit 0 (for example, when a CI step must
continue running downstream notification steps regardless of status).

## Config file

YAML or JSON. Example: [`examples/monitor-continuous.yaml`](../examples/monitor-continuous.yaml).

```yaml
frameworks: [SOC2, PCI-DSS, NIST-800-53]
schedule: daily
sources: [aws-inspector, github-inspector]
thresholds:
  warning: 0.90
  critical: 0.80
report_dir: ./monitor-reports
record_metrics:
  enabled: true
  config: ./automation-metrics.yaml
  window_label: current-week
```

## Output contract

stdout is a single JSON document. Downstream alerting tools (Slack, email,
PagerDuty) should key off `summary.overall_status`, `alerts[]`, and
`framework_results[].status`.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",

}
```

## What this command does not ship

By design, the runner is transport-agnostic. It does **not** POST to Slack,
send email, or page on-call. Those steps live in the host scheduler (examples
below), so the same run output can drive any combination of channels.

For trend analysis over time, consume the JSON output (or the `grc-data/metrics/`
snapshots written when `record_metrics` is enabled) with a reporting workflow
such as `/report:exec-summary`.

If you only need scheduled automation-history snapshots for the PR #54 reporting
flows, use the copy-pasteable GitHub Actions template at
[`examples/github-actions/automation-metrics-snapshot.yml`](../examples/github-actions/automation-metrics-snapshot.yml).

## Setup

### 1. Stage a config file

Copy `plugins/grc-engineer/examples/monitor-continuous.yaml` to your project
root and edit the framework list, thresholds, and optional
`record_metrics.config` pointer.

### 2. Schedule in your host

The runner itself is stateless; point a scheduler at it.

GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/compliance-monitor.yml
name: Continuous Compliance Monitoring

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 02:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  monitor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - run: npm ci

      - name: Run monitor-continuous
        run: |
          node plugins/grc-engineer/scripts/monitor-continuous.js \
            --config=./monitor-continuous.yaml \
            --output=./monitor-result.json
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Alert on threshold breach
        if: always()
        run: |
          STATUS=$(jq -r '.summary.overall_status' monitor-result.json)
          if [ "$STATUS" = "critical" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "warning" ]; then
            jq '.alerts' monitor-result.json
            exit 1
          fi
```

Cron on a runner:

```bash
0 2 * * *  cd /srv/grc && node plugins/grc-engineer/scripts/monitor-continuous.js \
             --config=./monitor-continuous.yaml --output=./monitor-result.json
```

### 3. Wire alerts downstream

The runner emits JSON; wiring to channels is a CI concern. Example Slack step
that only fires when the run crossed the warning threshold:

```yaml
- uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
  if: failure()
  with:
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "Compliance alert: $(jq -r '.summary.overall_status' monitor-result.json)",
        "attachments": $(jq '.alerts' monitor-result.json)
      }
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## Roadmap (not in this runner yet)

These were part of the original `/monitor-continuous` spec and are tracked for
follow-up:

- 30-day trend analysis over `grc-data/metrics/` history
- Control-health degradation detection (per-control pass rates over time)
- Built-in Slack/email/PagerDuty HTTP calls
- Live compliance dashboard
- Auto-remediation hooks

The example below was the narrative output described before the command had an
executable runner. It is kept for reference while reporting workflows continue
to build on this data. The actual runtime contract is the JSON shape above.
